**`Ultimate_IDE_Project_Creation_Guide_Template_V2.0.md`**  
*(adapted for StuckAI)*

**(Preamble - Instructions for Use)**  
This document is the **Ultimate Master Template** for collaboratively planning the **StuckAI** software application stack or service (`StuckAI`) with an AI Development Assistant (**Droid**) within an Integrated Development Environment (IDE).  
**Goal:** Upon completion and stakeholder approval, this filled guide will serve as the **primary input for Droid to instruct the IDE to automatically generate** all foundational project documentation files. These generated files will include:  
*   A project-specific Rules File (e.g., `StuckAI_Rules_V1.md`)  
*   The complete Memory Bank file structure and initial templates  
*   Standard log file templates  
*   The project's initial `tasks.md` tracker  
*   A placeholder `StuckAI_Development_Guide_V1.0.md`  
*   The initial `.gitignore` file  
*   The core project directory structure within the Application Code Root.  

Replace all bracketed placeholders (e.g., `[PROJECT_NAME]`, `[STAKEHOLDER_NAME]`, `[APPLICATION_NATURE]`) with your specific project details during the collaborative planning phase with Droid. This guide is designed to become your project's "Source of Truth" or "Project Bible."

## 1. Overall Mission, Task, Goal  

### 1.1 Mission of StuckAI  
To embed universal, context-aware AI into every application and pixel, empowering users to capture, organize, and act on their thoughts instantly through intelligent, colour-coded sticky notes.  

### 1.2 Task for **Droid**  
1. Populate this Creation Guide with The CrypDough.  
2. Generate foundational project files once guide is approved.  
3. Produce daily entries for `StuckAI_Development_Guide_V1.0.md` following the roadmap.  
4. Adhere to all rules in `StuckAI_Rules_V1.md`.  

### 1.3 Goal for StuckAI V1.0  
Launch a local-first desktop+web system that lets a user:  
1. Stick notes anywhere (files, code lines, windows, web).  
2. Chat with a powerful AI in each note (≥1 M tokens context).  
3. Visualize all notes inside the **Think Tank** dashboard as an interactive knowledge graph.  
4. Receive proactive insights and automate tasks through tool-calling super-agents.  

### 1.4 Droid Insight  
A crystal-clear mission-task-goal triad lets Droid reason unambiguously when generating code or plans.

---

## 2. Core Project Vision & Guiding Philosophies  

### 2.1 Core Concept & Unique Value Proposition  
StuckAI is a **system-level AI overlay**. Right-click anywhere → *Stick* → a collapsible, vividly coloured note containing a full AI workspace. A hybrid client stack (Electron desktop shell + Next.js web dashboard + React-Native companion) syncs all notes into a **Think Tank**—a real-time, zoomable knowledge graph that shows the user’s cognitive flow, full chat histories, and AI-suggested connections.  

* **Universal Compatibility** – Runs across Windows, macOS, Linux, major browsers.  
* **Centralized Cognitive Hub** – The Think Tank acts as a live mind-map with serendipity sandbox, daily cognitive digest, and predictive workflow launcher.  
* **Massive Context & Agency** – Each note offers ≥1 M-token context and super-agent tool-use via Modern Context Protocol servers.  
* **Local-First Privacy** – Data stays on device; cloud sync is E2E-encrypted.  

### 2.2 Target Users & Pains  
1. **Power Developers** – want in-IDE AI with long context and code actions.  
2. **Product & Design Leads** – need cross-app research snippets in one place.  
3. **Enterprise Knowledge Workers** – require secure, compliant AI with audit logs.  

Pain points: context-switching, lost snippets, fragmented AI tools, security fears.  

### 2.3 Development Ethos  
☑ Sophistication from Day Zero ☑ Documentation-Driven Development ☑ User-Centric Design ☑ Lean, Phased Delivery  

### 2.4 Quality Pillars  
1. Reliability 2. Intuitive UX 3. Actionable Intelligence 4. Secure-by-Design 5. Cost-Aware Scalability  

### 2.5 Persona Design  
*Brand Persona:* **Omnipresent Enabler** – confident, helpful, future-focused.  
*AI Persona:* **Adaptive & Contextual** – concise, proactive, emoji-lite 🙂.  

### 2.6 System Aesthetics & UX Directives  
Overall feel: **futuristic yet intuitive**.  
Key principles: bold simplicity, translucent overlays, fluid micro-animations, vibrant colour palette mapped to note categories.  
**Interactive Knowledge Graph:** Think Tank’s primary view; nodes = notes; edges = semantic/context links; real-time activity glows; drag-to-rearrange.  

### 2.7 Data & Knowledge Philosophy  
• Local-first encrypted DB • Living knowledge base auto-updates • Single source of truth • Open APIs for interoperability  

### 2.8 Droid Insight  
This “Soul” section guides tone, priorities, and architectural choices for every subsequent deliverable.

---

## 3. Current Project Status & Immediate Next Step  

*Status:* Planning phase complete; foundational empty files committed to GitHub.  
*Milestones achieved:* directory skeleton, empty docs, Windows 11 confirmed.  
*Immediate Next Task:* Droid to populate guides (current step) → Draft **Day 1** entry in `StuckAI_Development_Guide_V1.0.md` once content merge is done.

### 4.4 Stakeholder Role & Approval Process  
The CrypDough = vision holder & final arbiter. All completed Droid tasks require explicit “approved” before auto-update workflows.

---  
## 5. Definitive Plan for `StuckAI_Development_Guide_V1.0.md` Construction  
*(The Detailed “Roadmap”)*  

### 5.1 Roadmap Guiding Principles  
1. **Sophistication from Design Outset** – Build foundational, production-grade architecture from Day 1 to avoid MVP re-writes.  
2. **User-Obsessed Iteration** – Every sprint must deliver a tangible “wow!” for at least one core persona.  
3. **Hybrid Harmony** – “Capture Anywhere, Manage Centrally, Access Everywhere.” Desktop, Dashboard, and Mobile are coordinated but loosely coupled.  
4. **AI First-Class Citizen** – IAIE integration, 1 M+ token context, tool-calling in every note.  
5. **Right-Click, Game Changed** – Frictionless onboarding: stick a note in < 2 s. Viral loops first.  
6. **Security & Privacy by Design** – Zero-trust, SQLCipher, Vault, E2E sync.  
7. **Performance as a Feature** – Sub-second note spawn; first LLM token in < 300 ms.  
8. **DocGen Rigor** – Creation Guide → Rules → Daily Guide. Single source of truth.  
9. **API-Driven Modularity** – Clean, documented APIs for every micro-service; Think Tank uses them as a client.  
10. **Proactive External Knowledge Acquisition** – Flag dependencies early (see 5.K) to keep momentum.

## 10. Stakeholder’s (The CrypDough) Core Motivations & Unshakeable Vision (The “North Star”)

| # | Core Motivation | Implication for StuckAI |
|---|-----------------|-------------------------|
| 10.1 | **Ignite the Universal AI Revolution & End Dumb Software** | Every pixel becomes AI-aware. StuckAI must embed intelligence seamlessly into all apps and contexts, proving “dumb software” obsolete. |
| 10.2 | **Empower Millions of Everyday People to Chase Their Dreams** | UX must be effortless; freemium onboarding; local-first privacy. AI agents act as personal co-creators, lowering barriers to ambition. |
| 10.3 | **Create a Central Hub that Slays Tool & Context-Switching Chaos** | Think Tank dashboard is mission-critical: global search, graph view, cross-app automation. |
| 10.4 | **Advance Human Potential Through Cognitive Enhancement** | Long-context reasoning, memory, proactive agents (Precog, FlowState). Ethical guardrails and accessibility baked in. |

`[Droid Insight]` – These motivations override all secondary goals; when trade-offs arise, optimise for these four pillars.

### 12.4 Full Example Feature Entry – **DTA-WIN-001**

* **Feature ID:** DTA-WIN-001  
* **Feature Name:** Windows Right-Click Hook – “Stick 🗒️” Shell Extension  
* **Associated Days:** Phase 0 Day 4-10  
* **Core Vision & Business Purpose:** One-click entry for Windows users; essential for viral adoption by eliminating friction.  
* **Key Functionality & User Stories:**  
  * User right-clicks any file/selection → context menu shows **Stick 🗒️**.  
  * Selection metadata (path, window HWND, coordinates) sent to `anchor-note-svc`.  
* **Technical Mechanics:**  
  * Rust DLL implementing `IShellExtInit` + `IContextMenu`.  
  * Communicates with Electron via named pipe (`\\.\pipe\stuckai-ipc`).  
* **Interaction / Dependencies:** Depends on `BES-CORE-001` IPC protocol; feeds DTA-IPC-001.  
* **Doing Better Pillars:** Secure (signed DLL), UX (≤150 ms launch), Reliability (fallback overlay if shell hook fails).  
* **Data Model Impact:** Adds `anchors.kind = 'FileRange' | 'WindowRect'`.  
* **Key Prompts:** “Generate shell extension code in Rust exposing context payload schema.”  
* **Success Criteria:** Right-click works on Win11; anchor created; overlay appears.  
* **External Docs:** Microsoft Shell Ext docs, windows-rs crate.

*Note: All other placeholder IDs will be fleshed out collaboratively as we progress through daily development.*
