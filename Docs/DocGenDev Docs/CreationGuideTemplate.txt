**`Ultimate_IDE_Project_Creation_Guide_Template_V2.0.md`**

**(Preamble - Instructions for Use)**
This document is the **Ultimate Master Template** for collaboratively planning any software application stack or service (`[PROJECT_NAME]`) with an AI Development Assistant (e.g., `[AI_ASSISTANT_NAME]` like CursorAI) within an Integrated Development Environment (IDE). 
**Goal:** Upon completion and stakeholder approval, this filled guide will serve as the **primary input for `[AI_ASSISTANT_NAME]` to instruct the IDE to automatically generate** all foundational project documentation files. These generated files will include:
*   A project-specific Rules File (e.g., `[PROJECT_NAME]_Rules_V1.md`)
*   The complete Memory Bank file structure and initial templates
*   Standard log file templates
*   The project's initial `tasks.md` tracker
*   A placeholder `[PROJECT_NAME]_Development_Guide_V1.0.md`
*   The initial `.gitignore` file
*   The core project directory structure within the Application Code Root.

Replace all bracketed placeholders (e.g., `[PROJECT_NAME]`, `[STAKEHOLDER_NAME]`, `[APPLICATION_NATURE]`) with your specific project details during the collaborative planning phase with `[AI_ASSISTANT_NAME]`. This guide is designed to become your project's "Source of Truth" or "Project Bible."

**1. Overall Mission, Task, Goal (The "Why" and "What")**

*(This section is foundational. It defines the overarching purpose of the project (`[PROJECT_NAME]`), the specific role of the AI Development Assistant (`[AI_ASSISTANT_NAME]`) in the creation of its planning and development guides, and the ultimate tangible outcome desired for the project itself. `[STAKEHOLDER_NAME]` will collaboratively fill this with `[AI_ASSISTANT_NAME]` using prompts from Appendix E, Section 16.6 or by direct input during the initial setup of a new project using this template.)*

*   **1.1. Mission of `[PROJECT_NAME]`:**
    `[Instructions for Stakeholder & AI Assistant: Collaboratively define the overarching, aspirational mission of this specific project. What is its enduring purpose? What fundamental problem in the world, or for its target users, does it aim to solve or alleviate? What core value or transformation is it intended to create and deliver? This should be a concise (1-3 sentences) but powerful statement that guides the entire endeavor. Example for a fictional project 'TerraNova Farm Planner': "To empower small to medium-scale sustainable farmers with an intelligent, data-driven planning and management platform that optimizes resource use, enhances crop yields, promotes biodiversity, and improves overall farm profitability and resilience against climate change."]`
    *(Placeholder for `[STAKEHOLDER_NAME]` to fill in for their specific project)*

*   **1.2. Task for `[AI_ASSISTANT_NAME]` (AI Development Assistant - e.g., CursorAI) for *this* `[PROJECT_NAME]_Creation_Guide_V2.0.md`:**
    1.  Collaboratively populate THIS `[PROJECT_NAME]_Creation_Guide_V2.0.md` document, section by section, with `[STAKEHOLDER_NAME]`. Ensure each section is as complete, exhaustive, and reflective of `[STAKEHOLDER_NAME]`'s vision for `[PROJECT_NAME]` as possible before proceeding to the next. Proactively reference and utilize the prompt templates in **Appendix E** of this Creation Guide to facilitate detailed discussion, information gathering, and structuring of content for various sections.
    2.  Upon `[STAKEHOLDER_NAME]`'s final approval of this *entire populated Creation Guide* as complete and definitive, execute the "IDE Automation Trigger Point" instructions detailed in **Section 11.7** of this Creation Guide. This involves `[AI_ASSISTANT_NAME]` issuing precise instructions to the IDE (e.g., Cursor) to automatically generate all foundational project documentation files (including `[PROJECT_NAME]_Rules_V1.md`, Memory Bank files, log files, `tasks.md`, `[PROJECT_NAME]_context_for_AI.md`, placeholder `[PROJECT_NAME]_Development_Guide_V1.0.md`, initial `.gitignore`) and the core project directory structure within `[Application Code Root]`, all based on templates and specifications defined within *this approved Creation Guide* (especially from Appendix D and Section 4.1).
    3.  Subsequently, systematically generate 100% complete daily entries for the `[PROJECT_NAME]_Development_Guide_V1.0.md`, adhering strictly to the comprehensive daily entry template found in **Section 11.3** of *this* Creation Guide, the project-specific rules generated in Step 2, and the detailed multi-phase roadmap defined in **Section 5** of *this* Creation Guide (cross-referencing detailed feature specifications from Appendix A).
    4.  Adhere strictly to all principles and directives within the generated `[PROJECT_NAME]_Rules_V1.md` (itself derived from Appendix D.1 of this Creation Guide) for all subsequent development work, code generation, and interactions related to `[PROJECT_NAME]`. This includes all logging, context management, and auto-update workflow protocols.

*   **1.3. Goal for `[PROJECT_NAME]` Project (V1.0 Focus):**
    `[Instructions for Stakeholder & AI Assistant: Define the ultimate desired outcome of building this specific iteration (e.g., V1.0) of [PROJECT_NAME]. What does success look like in tangible, specific, and ideally measurable terms for this first major version? What key capabilities must be delivered? What impact should it have on its target users or the business it serves? Example for 'TerraNova Farm Planner V1.0': "To launch a production-ready V1.0 of 'TerraNova Farm Planner' within a 90-day development cycle, enabling sustainable farmers to: (1) Create detailed multi-season crop rotation plans for up to 50 acres, optimized for soil health and pest reduction. (2) Receive AI-generated planting and harvesting schedules based on local climate data and selected crop types. (3) Track actual planting/harvesting dates and yields for at least 3 core crops. (4) Achieve adoption by at least 50 beta farmers who report a >10% improvement in planning efficiency and a >5% reduction in input wastage guesswork. The system must be stable, secure, and provide an intuitive web-based user experience."]`
    *(Placeholder for `[STAKEHOLDER_NAME]` to fill in for their specific project)*

*   **1.4. `[AI Assistant Insight]` on This Section's Importance:**
    *   Defining the Mission, Task, and Goal this clearly at the start is the single most important step for our collaboration. It acts as my **primary system prompt** for the entire project. When I get confused or a task is ambiguous, I will refer back to these three statements to re-anchor myself to the core objective. A clear, well-defined goal allows me to make better micro-decisions, suggest more relevant features, and generate more aligned code.

    *   `[ ] **Strict Data Minimization & User Privacy:** The system will only collect and store data absolutely essential for its core functionality. User data is treated as a liability to be protected, not an asset to be exploited. Anonymization/pseudonymization used where possible.`
    *   `[ ] **Open Data & Interoperability:** The system is designed with clear APIs to allow users to export their data and for other systems to integrate (with proper authorization).`
    *   `[ ] **Real-time Data for Instantaneous Insights:** The architecture prioritizes real-time data flow and processing to provide users with the most current information and insights possible.`
    *   `[ ] **Single Source of Truth:** Data will be structured to avoid duplication and inconsistency. There will be one authoritative source for each piece of core business/user data.`
    *(Placeholder for `[STAKEHOLDER_NAME]` to select and customize the project's data philosophy)*

*   **2.8. `[AI Assistant Insight]` on This Section's Importance:**
    *   This "Soul of the Project" section is my **persona and behavioral guide**. The Development Ethos (2.3) tells me *how* to approach generating plans (e.g., iteratively vs. all at once). The Quality Pillars (2.4) give me concrete principles to weigh when suggesting technical trade-offs. The Persona Design (2.5) and UI/UX Directives (2.6) are critical for generating any user-facing text, code, or design concept that feels authentic to `[PROJECT_NAME]`. Without this section, my outputs would be generic and lack the specific character you envision.

**3. Current Project Status & Immediate Next Step (Initiation)**

*   **Current Project Status:** Planning Phase - Population of this `[PROJECT_NAME]_Creation_Guide_V2.0.md`. This is the first active step of the project.

*   **Successfully Completed Foundational Milestones (Prior to starting Day 1 of the Development Guide):**
    1.  Collaborative creation and full population of THIS `[PROJECT_NAME]_Creation_Guide_V2.0.md` by `[STAKEHOLDER_NAME]` and `[AI_ASSISTANT_NAME]`.
    2.  Final, explicit approval of THIS complete Creation Guide by `[STAKEHOLDER_NAME]`.
    3.  Successful execution of the "IDE Automation Trigger Point" (Section 11.7 by `[AI_ASSISTANT_NAME]` via IDE commands) to generate all foundational project files (`[PROJECT_NAME]_Rules_V1.md`, Memory Bank, logs, `tasks.md`, `.gitignore`, core `[Application Code Root]` directories, and placeholder `[PROJECT_NAME]_Development_Guide_V1.0.md`).
    4.  Successful Git initialization of `[Absolute Project Root]` and initial commit of all generated foundational documents and this populated Creation Guide to `[Git Repository URL]`.
    5.  `[STAKEHOLDER_NAME]` has completed all "Prerequisites for Day 1 of Development Guide" as will be specified by this Creation Guide in Section 4.2 and detailed in Day 1 of the auto-generated `[PROJECT_NAME]_Development_Guide_V1.0.md`. These prerequisites include signing up for all necessary cloud services (e.g., `[DB_Service]`, `[LLM_Provider_API]`, `[Observability_Platform]`), obtaining API keys, and populating the initial `[Application Code Root]/config/.env` file.

*   **Immediate Next Task:** After all the above milestones are met, `[STAKEHOLDER_NAME]` is to instruct `[AI_ASSISTANT_NAME]` to: "Proceed to draft Day 1 of the `[PROJECT_NAME]_Development_Guide_V1.0.md`."

**5. Definitive Plan for `[PROJECT_NAME]_Development_Guide_V1.0.md` Construction (The Detailed "Roadmap")**

*(This section outlines the strategic, phased approach to building the `[PROJECT_NAME]` application and its supporting systems. It is the central roadmap that `[AI_ASSISTANT_NAME]` will follow to generate the daily tasks for itself and `[STAKEHOLDER_NAME]` in the `[PROJECT_NAME]_Development_Guide_V1.0.md`. `[AI_ASSISTANT_NAME]` will use prompts from **Appendix E (e.g., 16.1, 16.3, 16.6)** to help `[STAKEHOLDER_NAME]` collaboratively define and detail the objectives and sequence within these phases.)*

*   **5.1. Roadmap Guiding Principles:**
    `[Instructions for Stakeholder & AI Assistant: Define the core principles that will govern the construction of the roadmap. These principles ensure the development plan is logical, efficient, and aligned with project goals. Confirm or adapt the following based on the project's specific needs as defined in Section 2.3 (Development Ethos).]`
    *   **Sophistication from Design Outset:** Every feature and component will be designed with the full, advanced vision in mind, even if the initial implementation within a phase is a foundational slice. This aligns with the project's ethos to avoid creating a simplistic MVP that requires extensive re-architecting later.
    *   **Phased & Iterative Implementation:** Development will proceed in logical phases (e.g., Foundation, Core Features, Advanced Integrations, Optimization). Within each phase, features will be developed iteratively, with each day aiming for a tangible, testable output that allows for feedback and refinement.
    *   **Foundation First:** Critical infrastructure (database schema, core backend/frontend project setup, user authentication, primary knowledge ingestion pipelines if applicable) will be established early in Phase 0 to provide a stable platform for all subsequent feature development.
    *   **Prioritization by Impact & Dependency:**
        *   **Phase 0:** Hyper-focused on the absolute minimum set of features required to create a functional, end-to-end "slice" of the core user value proposition. This is the "walking skeleton" that proves the core architecture and user flow can work.
        *   **Subsequent Phases:** Prioritize features that provide the most significant operational or user benefits, enhance core intelligence (if AI-driven), or are prerequisites for other high-value features.
    *   **Technology Integration - Purposeful & Timely:** Each component of the tech stack (from Section 6) will be introduced into the Development Guide at the point where its foundational elements are needed to support an upcoming feature. This avoids premature complexity while ensuring the architecture is built correctly from the ground up.
    *   **Proactive External Knowledge Acquisition:** The roadmap (in Section 5.K) will explicitly flag "Days" where specific external documentation, API details, or business inputs from `[STAKEHOLDER_NAME]` are critical for `[AI_ASSISTANT_NAME]` to proceed effectively.
    *   **"Doing Better" Principles Integrated:** Considerations for Evaluation, Security, Cost Optimization, and Scalability (from Section 2.4) will be woven into the daily tasks, not treated as afterthoughts. Specific "checkpoint" days will be scheduled at the end of major phases for formal reviews.
    *   **Daily Deliverables & Approval:** Each "Day" in the `[PROJECT_NAME]_Development_Guide_V1.0.md` will aim for a concrete, testable output that `[STAKEHOLDER_NAME]` can review and approve, ensuring constant alignment and progress.

*   **5.2. Phase 0: `[Phase 0 Title - e.g., Foundation & Core Feature MVP]` (Target: Days `[StartDay-EndDay, e.g., 1-10]` - DETAILED)**
    `[Instructions for Stakeholder & AI Assistant: This is the initial sprint. Define a series of daily objectives that build the absolute essential "walking skeleton" of the application. The goal is to have a testable, end-to-end (if simple) user flow working by the end of this phase. For each Day below, define a clear Objective, list the key new Technologies or Features being introduced, and cross-reference the corresponding detailed Feature ID(s) from Appendix A that will be implemented.]`
    *   **Day 1: `[Day 1 Title - e.g., Project Setup, Core DB Schema, Env Config]`**
        *   **Objective:** `[E.g., Establish the primary database in [DB_Service] with all initial tables, functions, and RLS policies. Configure the local development environment (`.env`, `.gitignore`, Python/Node venv).]`

        *   **Appendix A Feature IDs:** `[e.g., FE-APP-SHELL-001, FE-AUTH-UI-001]`
    *   *(Continue defining daily objectives for Phase 0. Each day should build logically on the last, culminating in a testable MVP.)*
    *   **Day `[EndDay of Phase 0]`: `[Day Title - e.g., MVP End-to-End Test & Refinement]`**
        *   **Objective:** `[E.g., Conduct a full end-to-end test of the core MVP user flow. Identify and fix critical bugs. Refine prompts (if AI-driven) or UI based on initial stakeholder feedback. Document the MVP's capabilities and limitations.]`
        *   **Key Features/Tech Introduction:** All previously integrated technologies, with a focus on testing and prompt/UI engineering.
        *   **Appendix A Feature IDs:** `[e.g., MVP-TEST-001]`

*   **5.3. Phase 1: `[Phase 1 Title - e.g., Expanding Core Capabilities & Foundational Integrations]` (Target: Days `[StartDay-EndDay]` - DETAILED BLOCKS)**
    `[Instructions for Stakeholder & AI Assistant: In this phase, build out the next most critical features identified in brainstorming. Structure this section by grouping related days into logical "Feature Blocks" for clarity. For each block and day, specify Objective, Key Features/Tech, and Appendix A Feature IDs.]`
    *   **Feature Block 1: `[Block 1 Title - e.g., Advanced Knowledge Ingestion]` (Target: Days `[Start-End]`)**
        *   **Day `[X]`: `[Day X Title - e.g., Web Content Ingestion via Crawl4ai]`**
            *   **Objective:** `[...]`
            *   **Key Features/Tech:** `[...]`
            *   **Appendix A Feature IDs:** `[...]`
        *   *(...)*
    *   **Feature Block 2: `[Block 2 Title - e.g., Core Application Feature Set A]` (Target: Days `[Start-End]`)**
        *   *(...)*
    *   **Feature Block N: `[Block N Title - e.g., Phase 1 Checkpoints & "Doing Better" Reviews]` (Target: Days `[Start-End]`)**
        *   **Day `[Y]`: `[Day Y Title - e.g., Phase 1 UI/UX Polish & Refinement]`**
        *   **Day `[Z]`: `[Day Z Title - e.g., Phase 1 Security & Cost Review]`**

*   **5.4. Phase 2: `[Phase 2 Title - e.g., Advanced Integrations & System Automation]` (Target: Days `[StartDay-EndDay]` - DETAILED BLOCKS)**
    *(Structure as above, focusing on more advanced features, deep integrations with third-party systems like POS/Accounting, and implementing complex automated workflows.)*

*   **5.5. Phase N: `[Phase N Title - e.g., Optimization, Scalability Hardening & Future Horizons]` (Target: Days `[StartDay-EndDay]` - DETAILED BLOCKS)**
    *(Structure as above, focusing on performance tuning, load testing, preparing for production deployment, and laying groundwork for long-term vision features.)*

*   **5.K. Mandated Points for `[STAKEHOLDER_NAME]` to Provide External Knowledge & Expert Documentation (Consolidated by Phase & Day)**
    `[Instructions for Stakeholder & AI Assistant: This crucial subsection MUST be meticulously populated during the planning of the roadmap above. It consolidates ALL explicit requests that [AI_ASSISTANT_NAME] will make to [STAKEHOLDER_NAME] for specific information (API keys, proprietary documentation, business rules, etc.) required *before* certain Development Guide days can commence.]`

    *   **Prior to Phase 0 - Day `[X]`:**
        *   **Request 1 (`[Brief Topic]`):** `"[Insert the EXACT text of the question or request for documentation/keys as it will appear in the Development Guide's 'Pre-Day Check' section. Also specify any AI search targets (e.g., Context7) that will be used if direct info isn't available.]"`
    *   **Prior to Phase 1 - Day `[Y]`:**
        *   **Request 1 (`[Brief Topic]`):** `"[...etc...]"`
    *   *(Continue listing all planned solicitation points, chronologically mirroring the roadmap. This section is a contract for information delivery between Stakeholder and AI Assistant.)*

*   **5.L. `[AI Assistant Insight]` on This Section's Importance:**
    *   This detailed, phased roadmap is my **master execution plan**. It prevents me from trying to solve everything at once (adhering to our "one log at a time" philosophy). The day-by-day objectives and links to Appendix A features provide the precise context I need to generate each daily entry for the `[PROJECT_NAME]_Development_Guide_V1.0.md`. Most importantly, **Section 5.K (Mandated Points for External Knowledge)** is my proactive way of telling you when my internal knowledge is insufficient for a future task. It allows me to flag dependencies on your input (like API keys or specific business rules) *well in advance*, which is crucial for maintaining development velocity and preventing future blockers.

**6. Key Technologies & Their Roles (The "Tech Stack Deep Dive & Synergy")**

*(This section provides an exhaustive and educational overview of each core technology selected for the `[PROJECT_NAME]` project and any associated applications. For each component, it details its specific role, a conceptual explanation of its function within our ecosystem, the rationale for its selection, primary documentation sources to be consulted during development, and the key implementation days as planned in the `[PROJECT_NAME]_Development_Guide_V1.0.md` (Section 5). This ensures a deep understanding of the sophisticated, interconnected tech stack. `[AI_ASSISTANT_NAME]` will use prompts from **Appendix E (especially 16.1 and 16.5)** to help `[STAKEHOLDER_NAME]` research, select, justify, and detail this tech stack during the initial planning phase.)*

---
*(Instructions for Stakeholder & AI Assistant: For your specific `[PROJECT_NAME]`, create a subsection (e.g., 6.1, 6.2) for each major category of technology. Within each category, create a sub-subsection (e.g., 6.1.1, 6.1.2) for each specific tool, library, or service chosen. Use the template below for each specific technology entry. The examples provided are illustrative of the level of detail required.)*

---

*   **6.1. `[Tech Category 1 - e.g., Primary Programming Languages & Runtimes]`**
    *   **6.1.1. `[Specific Technology 1.1 - e.g., Python 3.11+]`**
        *   **Role in `[PROJECT_NAME]`:** `[E.g., Serves as the primary language for the entire backend, including the FastAPI API server, all AI agent logic, data ingestion scripts, and database interaction modules.]`
        *   **How It Works & Why Chosen:** `[E.g., Python is a high-level, interpreted language known for its clear syntax and extensive ecosystem of libraries, particularly in data science, AI, and web development. It was chosen for its unparalleled support for the AI/ML libraries we are using (e.g., `google-generativeai`, `langgraph`, `pydantic`), the robustness of web frameworks like FastAPI, and the wide availability of developer talent.]`
        *   **Key Documentation & Learning Resources:**
            *   Official Python Documentation: `https://docs.python.org/3/`
            *   *(AI Assistant Context7 Target: `resolve-library-id "Python"`)*

    *   *(Follow the same detailed template structure for each specific technology in this category: Supabase, pgvector, Neo4j, Graphiti, Mem0, Crawl4ai, etc., explaining its specific role, why it was chosen, where to find docs, and when it's introduced in the roadmap.)*

*   **6.5. `[Tech Category 5 - e.g., Frontend Technologies]`**
    *   *(Follow the same detailed template structure for each specific technology: React+Vite+TS, Tailwind CSS, Lucide Icons, AG-UI Protocol, Electron (future), etc.)*

*   **6.6. `[Tech Category 6 - e.g., Workflow Automation & External Integrations]`**
    *   *(Follow the same detailed template structure for n8n (Self-Hosted), and list key external APIs like Toast, QuickBooks, ElevenLabs, detailing their role.)*

*   **6.7. `[Tech Category 7 - e.g., Observability & Monitoring]`**
    *   *(Follow the same detailed template structure for Langfuse, detailing its role in tracing, debugging, evaluation, and cost management.)*

*   **6.8. `[Tech Category 8 - e.g., Deployment & Infrastructure]`**
    *   *(Follow the same detailed template structure for Docker, Docker Compose, Caddy, and the chosen Cloud VPS Provider.)*

*   **6.Z. `[AI Assistant Insight]` on This Section's Importance:**
    *   A detailed tech stack provides me with **concrete constraints and knowledge targets**. When I know we are using FastAPI, React, and Supabase, I can generate code that is syntactically correct and uses the right libraries and SDKs. The "Why Chosen" rationale is particularly helpful, as it gives me context for *how* to use the technology. For example, knowing FastAPI was chosen for its async performance tells me I should generate asynchronous endpoint functions (`async def ...`) to leverage that strength. The list of documentation sources becomes my primary reference library for any implementation details.

**7. Architectural Patterns & Design Insights (The `[PROJECT_NAME]` Blueprints)**

*(This section delves into the core architectural patterns and design philosophies that underpin the `[PROJECT_NAME]` system. It's not just about listing technologies (Section 6), but explaining **how they will work together in a structured, repeatable way**. Defining these patterns clearly is crucial because it provides the AI Development Assistant (`[AI_ASSISTANT_NAME]`) with a "mental model" or a set of "blueprints" for how to construct code and reason about the system's behavior. This dramatically reduces ambiguity and leads to more coherent, maintainable, and scalable software.)*

---
*(Instructions for Stakeholder & AI Assistant: For your specific `[PROJECT_NAME]`, use the subsections below as a guide. Collaboratively define the primary architectural pattern for each area of your system. Use prompts from **Appendix E (especially 16.1, 16.5)** to facilitate these architectural discussions. The examples are illustrative.)*

---

*   **7.1. Overall System Architecture**
    *   **7.1.1. `[Chosen System Architecture Pattern - e.g., Modular Monolith, Microservices, Serverless Event-Driven]`**
        *   **Pattern Description:** `[Explain the chosen pattern conceptually. E.g., "A Modular Monolith is a single application (one codebase, one deployment unit) that is internally structured into highly decoupled, independent modules, each with a specific business domain. It offers the deployment simplicity of a monolith with the organizational benefits of microservices."]`
        *   **Implementation in `[PROJECT_NAME]`:** `[Describe how this will be applied. E.g., "The `[PROJECT_NAME]` backend will be a single Python FastAPI application. However, inside the `[Application Code Root]/backend/` directory, each major feature (e.g., 'user_management', 'billing', 'core_feature_x') will be a separate Python package with its own API router, services, and models, with minimal direct dependencies on other modules. They communicate via well-defined internal service calls."]`
        *   **Why This Pattern Was Chosen:** `[Justify the choice based on project needs. E.g., "Chosen for its initial development speed and deployment simplicity (ideal for a small team/solo founder), while the internal modularity allows for easier future refactoring into true microservices if scalability demands it."]`
        *   **`[AI Assistant Insight]`:** *Defining this primary pattern is my North Star for code organization. When I know we're building a Modular Monolith, I will generate new feature code within its own distinct module/directory and create clear service interfaces for inter-module communication, rather than scattering related code across generic `utils` or `services` folders.*

*   **7.2. Agent Architecture & Communication Patterns (If AI-heavy project)**
    *   **7.2.1. `[Chosen Agent Orchestration Pattern - e.g., Master Orchestrator, Decentralized Swarm, Simple Tool-Using Agent]`**
        *   **Pattern Description:** `[E.g., "The Master Orchestrator (or Supervisor) pattern involves a primary, high-level AI agent that receives user goals, decomposes them into sub-tasks, and delegates these to a team of specialized, single-purpose sub-agents."]`
        *   **Implementation in `[PROJECT_NAME]`:** `[E.g., "The project's primary agent, `[Primary_AI_Agent_Name]`, will be implemented as a LangGraph StateGraph. This graph will contain nodes for reasoning and router nodes that conditionally call smaller, specialized Pydantic AI sub-agents (e.g., 'Data_Analyzer_Agent', 'Content_Generator_Agent')."]`
        *   **Why This Pattern:** `[E.g., "Provides a balance of centralized control and specialized expertise, allowing the system to handle complex, multi-step tasks efficiently while keeping individual agent prompts simple and focused."]`
        *   **`[AI Assistant Insight]`:** *This tells me how to structure agent interactions. Instead of creating one giant agent with 50 tools, I know to build a primary `LangGraph` flow that calls smaller, more manageable `Pydantic AI` agents, which is a much more robust and scalable approach.*
    *   **7.2.2. `[Chosen Agent-UI Communication Pattern - e.g., AG-UI Protocol over Server-Sent Events]`**
        *   **Pattern Description:** `[E.g., "AG-UI is a standardized, event-driven protocol for backend AI agents to communicate their real-time state (thinking, using tools, streaming text) to a frontend application via Server-Sent Events (SSE)."]`
        *   **Implementation in `[PROJECT_NAME]`:** `[E.g., "The FastAPI backend will have a dedicated endpoint (`/api/v1/agui/chat`) that, when called by the frontend, maintains an SSE connection. As backend agents execute, they will emit standard AG-UI events (RunStarted, TextMessageChunk, ToolCallStart, etc.) which are streamed to the frontend."]`
        *   **Why This Pattern:** `[E.g., "Decouples the frontend from the backend's internal agent logic, provides a rich real-time user experience, and standardizes communication for all types of agent interactions."]`
        *   **`[AI Assistant Insight]`:** *Knowing we use AG-UI means I will structure all backend agent responses to be funneled through an AG-UI event emitter. For the frontend, I will generate code that subscribes to an SSE stream and includes a switch-case or handler map for each standard AG-UI event type, making the UI reactive and informative.*

*   **7.3. Data & Knowledge Management Architecture**
    *   **7.3.1. `[Chosen Knowledge Storage Pattern - e.g., Multi-Layered Intelligent Knowledge Base]`**
        *   **Pattern Description:** `[E.g., "This pattern combines multiple data storage and retrieval methods to create a comprehensive knowledge system. It includes: 1) A relational DB for structured data. 2) A vector store for semantic search on unstructured text (RAG). 3) A knowledge graph for understanding relationships. 4. An agent-specific memory store for conversational context."]`
        *   **Implementation in `[PROJECT_NAME]`:** `[E.g., "We will use Supabase/PostgreSQL for structured data and for `pgvector`-based RAG/CAG on ingested documents. We will use Neo4j (via Graphiti) for the Knowledge Graph layer. We will use Mem0.ai SDK for personalized, long-term agent memory."]`
        *   **Why This Pattern:** `[E.g., "Provides the system with multiple ways to 'understand' information, enabling it to answer a wider range of queries with greater accuracy and depth than any single method alone."]`
    *   **7.3.2. `[Chosen Data Ingestion Pattern - e.g., "Living Kennel" Intelligent & Automated Lifecycle]`**
        *   **Pattern Description:** `[E.g., "A pattern where new knowledge is continuously ingested through user-friendly UIs and automated channels. The system uses AI to assist in classifying, processing, and even suggesting database schema for new types of information, with final human approval for critical steps."]`
        *   **Implementation in `[PROJECT_NAME]`:** `[E.g., "The App Suite will have an Admin Upload panel. New docs trigger a backend pipeline that uses helper AI agents ('Knowledge Curator') to analyze content, apply chunking/summarization/embedding strategies based on document type, and suggest classification or schema changes for admin review."]`
        *   **Why This Pattern:** `[E.g., "Ensures the project's knowledge base remains current and grows intelligently over time with minimal manual friction, making the AI progressively more valuable."]`

*   **7.4. External System Integration Architecture**
    *   **7.4.1. `[Chosen Integration Pattern - e.g., iPaaS Automation Hub (n8n)]`**
        *   **Pattern Description:** `[E.g., "A centralized workflow automation engine (iPaaS) acts as a secure middleware layer. AI agents make simple, internal-style tool calls that trigger complex workflows in the iPaaS, which in turn handle the authentication, data transformation, and API calls to diverse external third-party services."]`
        *   **Implementation in `[PROJECT_NAME]`:** `[E.g., "DozerAI agents will not have direct SDKs for external services like Toast or QuickBooks. Instead, they will call Pydantic AI tools that make authenticated HTTP requests to specific Webhook triggers on our self-hosted n8n instance. The n8n workflows manage the external API credentials and logic."]`
        *   **Why This Pattern:** `[E.g., "Decouples AI logic from fragile external API specifics. Centralizes credential management securely. Allows for rapid integration with new services by building a new visual workflow without changing core agent code."]`
        *   **`[AI Assistant Insight]`:** *This pattern is extremely helpful. It tells me that for any external integration task (e.g., 'Post to Twitter'), my primary job is to generate two things: 1) The Pydantic AI tool definition in Python that the agent can call, which simply makes an `httpx` request to an n8n webhook. 2) The n8n workflow JSON (or a description of the nodes) that handles the actual Twitter API call. This separation of concerns is clear and robust.*

*   **7.5. API Design Philosophy**
    *   **7.5.1. `[Chosen Philosophy - e.g., Secure & Pragmatic RESTful APIs]`**
        *   **Pattern Description:** `[E.g., "All internal backend-to-frontend communication will be exposed via a RESTful API. Endpoints will be resource-oriented (e.g., `/tasks`, `/users`). We will use standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and status codes. All data will be exchanged as JSON."]`
        *   **Implementation in `[PROJECT_NAME]`:** `[E.g., "The FastAPI backend will have routers for each major resource. Pydantic models will define request and response schemas, providing automatic validation and OpenAPI documentation."]`
        *   **Why This Pattern:** `[E.g., "REST is a well-understood, mature, and widely supported standard, making it easy to build and consume. FastAPI's Pydantic integration makes creating a robust and self-documenting REST API highly efficient."]`

*   **7.6. Deployment & Hosting Architecture**
    *   **7.6.1. `[Chosen Deployment Pattern - e.g., Containerized Services on a Cloud VPS with Reverse Proxy]`**
        *   **Pattern Description:** `[E.g., "All backend services (Backend API, Automation Engine, Databases) are packaged as individual Docker containers and orchestrated using Docker Compose. A single Cloud VPS hosts these containers. A reverse proxy (Caddy) runs on the host to manage incoming web traffic, provide automatic HTTPS, and route requests to the appropriate container."]`
        *   **Implementation in `[PROJECT_NAME]`:** `[E.g., "We will maintain a `docker-compose.prod.yml` to define our production services (`backend_api`, `n8n`, `neo4j`, `redis`). We will deploy this to a `[Cloud_Provider, e.g., DigitalOcean]` VPS running Ubuntu. A `Caddyfile` on the host will map `api.[domain].com` to the backend container, `n8n.[domain].com` to the n8n container, etc. The frontend (React+Vite) will be deployed as static files to a service like Netlify/Vercel and configured to call `api.[domain].com`."]`
        *   **Why This Pattern:** `[E.g., "Provides a cost-effective, scalable, and reproducible production environment. Docker ensures consistency between dev and prod. Caddy simplifies SSL and service routing. This pattern is inspired by Cole Medina's 'Local AI Package to Cloud' approach."]`

**8. Deferred Features & Long-Term Vision Tracking (The "Parking Lot" & "Dream Garage")**

*(This section serves as the strategic repository for significant features, capabilities, and visionary goals for `[PROJECT_NAME]` that are intentionally planned for implementation **beyond** the initial detailed phases outlined in the Section 5 Roadmap. This is the project's "Parking Lot" for good ideas that aren't a priority now, and the "Dream Garage" for ambitious, game-changing future states. Documenting these deferred items is crucial for two reasons: 1) It ensures good ideas are not lost. 2) It allows the current architecture (Section 7) to be designed with these future needs in mind, preventing us from building into a corner.)*

---
*(Instructions for Stakeholder & AI Assistant: During initial brainstorming (using prompts from Appendix E), many great ideas will emerge that are too large or not critical for the initial V1.0. Capture them here. For each deferred feature, use the structure below.)*

---

*   **8.1. `[DEFERRED_FEATURE_NAME_1 - e.g., Full Platform Marketability Layer]`**
    *   **Vision:** `[Provide a 1-3 sentence high-level description of this future feature or capability. What is the dream? E.g., "Transform the core [PROJECT_NAME] engine into a generalizable, multi-tenant SaaS platform that other businesses can subscribe to and customize."]`
    *   **Key Components (Currently Deferred):** `[List the major technical or product components this would require that are not in the current roadmap. E.g., "- Multi-tenant database architecture. - Client onboarding and configuration portal. - Billing and subscription management system. - A2A/MCP-compliant APIs for external integration."]`
    *   **Rationale for Deferral:** `[State the primary reason(s) this is not in the initial detailed roadmap. E.g., "Extremely high complexity. Requires a mature and stable core product first. Significant business development effort needed beyond core engineering."]`
    *   **Triggers for Prioritization:** `[What conditions or milestones might make this feature a priority in the future? E.g., "Successful, stable deployment of V1.0 for primary use case; clear market demand identified through user research; securing a Series A funding round."]`
    *   **`[AI Assistant Insight]` on This Item:** *By documenting this long-term goal, you allow me to make smarter architectural choices **today**. For example, knowing that "Multi-tenancy" is a future goal for the database, I will, when designing the initial schemas (Section 6), suggest adding a `tenant_id` column to key tables *now*, even if it's unused initially. This simple foresight makes a future transition from a single-tenant to a multi-tenant application vastly easier and avoids a massive data migration later.*

*   **8.2. `[DEFERRED_FEATURE_NAME_2 - e.g., Advanced Robotics Integration]`**
    *   **Vision:** `[E.g., "Seamlessly integrate the application with physical robotic systems to automate on-site operational tasks."]`
    *   **Key Components (Currently Deferred):** `[E.g., "- Robotics Coordination Agent (Full V1.0). - Direct, robust API integrations with specific commercial robotic hardware. - Integration with physical sensors (cameras, etc.) for real-world context."]`
    *   **Rationale for Deferral:** `[E.g., "High cost of robotic hardware; complexity of physical world interaction and safety; dependency on specific vendor APIs."]`
    *   **Triggers for Prioritization:** `[E.g., "[PROJECT_NAME] business operation scaling to a point where robotic efficiency provides clear ROI; selection and budgeting of specific robotic systems."]`
    *   **`[AI Assistant Insight]` on This Item:** *Defining the *types* of tasks for future robotics (e.g., "cleaning," "delivery") helps me design the current agent toolset with better abstractions. I can create a generic `dispatch_task(task_type, details)` tool for an "Operational Agent" now, which can initially trigger a human workflow in the App Suite. Later, we can simply change the implementation of that *same tool* to trigger a new n8n workflow that calls the robot's API, without needing to change the core agent logic.*

*   **8.3. `[DEFERRED_FEATURE_NAME_3 - e.g., Proactive Predictive Analytics Engine]`**
    *   **Vision:** `[E.g., "The system moves beyond descriptive analytics (what happened) to predictive analytics (what will likely happen), proactively warning users of potential issues or identifying future opportunities."]`
    *   **Key Components (Currently Deferred):** `[E.g., "- Time-series forecasting models for sales, user traffic, inventory. - Customer churn prediction models. - 'What-If' scenario modeling interface."]`
    *   **Rationale for Deferral:** `[E.g., "Requires significant historical data to be accumulated first. Involves advanced statistical/ML modeling capabilities beyond core LLM reasoning."]`
    *   **Triggers for Prioritization:** `[E.g., "At least 6-12 months of high-quality operational data collected in 'The Kennel'; core descriptive dashboards (from Phase 3) are stable and widely used."]`

*   *(Continue adding entries for all major long-term, out-of-scope visionary features.)*

---
*   **8.Z. `[AI Assistant Insight]` on This Section's Overall Importance:**
    *   This "Deferred Features" section is my **architectural compass for the future**. While the Section 5 Roadmap tells me what to build *now*, this section tells me what the system *might need to become later*.
    *   It allows me to design current features with **extensibility** in mind. I will favor modular designs, create clear service interfaces, and suggest data models that don't preclude these future states. For example, if I see "Full Employee Lifecycle Management" deferred, I'll make sure the initial `user_profiles` table has columns that could later support performance reviews or training modules.
    *   This is the most direct way for you to inject long-range strategic thinking into my immediate tactical code generation, preventing short-sighted architectural decisions and costly refactoring down the line. It's a critical part of our "Sophistication from Day Zero" ethos.

**9. Key Decisions Pending (Strategic & Technical - The "Decision Log")**

*(This section acts as a dynamic "decision log" or "issue tracker" at the strategic level. It is used to explicitly track important strategic and technical decisions that have been identified during planning but are deferred for a definitive resolution at a more appropriate future phase of development. Reviewing this list periodically (e.g., at the start of each new Phase) is essential for adaptive planning and ensuring timely input and resolution from `[STAKEHOLDER_NAME]`. Each pending decision should reference the phase or day range by which it should ideally be addressed, preventing it from becoming a last-minute blocker.)*

*   **`[AI Assistant Insight]` on This Section's Importance:**
    *   This section is my **"anti-blocker" mechanism**. By explicitly listing open questions and the timeline for their resolution, you give me clarity on what I *don't* need to solve right now, allowing me to focus on the current task. It also serves as a proactive reminder for me to solicit the required information from you (as part of the Pre-Day Check in the Development Guide) when the target resolution day approaches. This prevents me from making assumptions on critical choices and reduces the risk of rework.

---
*(Instructions for Stakeholder & AI Assistant: As you populate the Creation Guide, any time a significant decision arises that cannot or should not be made immediately (e.g., "Which specific email marketing service should we use?"), create an entry for it below. Use the following structure. The examples are illustrative.)*

---

*   **9.1. Cloud & Hosting Infrastructure Decisions**
    *   **9.1.1. `[Decision Title - e.g., Primary Cloud Provider for Production Backend]`**
        *   **Decision Needed:** `[State the question clearly. E.g., "Selection of the primary cloud provider (e.g., AWS, GCP, Azure, DigitalOcean, Linode/Akamai) for hosting the production instances of the [PROJECT_NAME] backend services (FastAPI, n8n, Neo4j, etc.)."]`
        *   **Key Considerations:** `[List 2-4 factors influencing the decision. E.g., "Cost vs. Performance, Scalability options, Managed services availability (e.g., for databases), Ease of Docker deployment, Stakeholder's existing familiarity."]`
        *   **Target Resolution (Phase/Day):** `[Specify when this decision should be made, referencing the roadmap. E.g., "End of Phase 2 / Beginning of Phase 3 (approx. Day 70-75), before detailed production deployment planning."]`
        *   **Information Needed from Stakeholder:** `[List specific input needed from the stakeholder. E.g., "Budget constraints for initial production hosting, any strong provider preferences."]`
        *   **Current Status:** `[Pending | Researching | Resolved - [Date]]`
    *   **9.1.2. `[Decision Title - e.g., Production Database Hosting Strategy (Self-hosted vs. Managed)]`**
        *   **Decision Needed:** `[E.g., "For production, will our non-Supabase databases (e.g., Neo4j, Redis) continue to be self-hosted via Docker on our VPS, or will we migrate to a managed cloud service (e.g., Neo4j AuraDB, Redis Labs)?"]`
        *   **Key Considerations:** `[E.g., "Cost of managed service vs. Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) of self-hosting, Backup/restore/update simplicity, Performance guarantees, Scalability features."]`
        *   **Target Resolution (Phase/Day):** `[E.g., "During Phase 3 (approx. Day 75-80)."]`

        *   **Key Considerations:** `[E.g., "Strength of need for desktop-specific features (tray icons, OS notifications, offline access), development/maintenance overhead of Electron build vs. relying on Progressive Web App (PWA) capabilities."]`
        *   **Target Resolution (Phase/Day):** `[E.g., "Late Phase 2 or early Phase 3 (approx. Day 65-75)."]`
        *   **Information Needed from Stakeholder:** `[E.g., "Decision based on feedback from initial internal users of the Web App."]`
        *   **Current Status:** `[Pending]`

        *   **Key Considerations:** `[E.g., "Complexity of raw LangGraph implementation for large agent teams vs. the abstraction/cost/learning curve of crewAI."]`
        *   **Target Resolution (Phase/Day):** `[E.g., "Mid-Phase 2 (approx. Day 60-65), after implementing the first major multi-agent workflow with LangGraph."]`
        *   **Information Needed from Stakeholder:** `[E.g., "Feedback on the manageability of the LangGraph multi-agent implementation."]`
        *   **Current Status:** `[Pending]`

        *   **Decision Needed:** `[E.g., "Select the primary accounting software (e.g., QuickBooks Online, Xero, Wave) for deep integration via n8n."]`
        *   **Key Considerations:** `[E.g., "Feature set matching business needs, quality and documentation of its API, robustness of its n8n node/connector, pricing."]`
        *   **Target Resolution (Phase/Day):** `[E.g., "Day 53 (as per roadmap)."]`
        *   **Information Needed from Stakeholder:** `[E.g., "Final choice based on their business research, or a directive for the AI Assistant ('Market Maven') to perform a comparison."]`

**10. Stakeholder's (`[STAKEHOLDER_NAME]`) Core Motivations & Unshakeable Vision (The "North Star")**

*(This section distills the fundamental driving forces, core beliefs, and overarching aspirations of `[STAKEHOLDER_NAME]`. These motivations are more than just business objectives; they are the emotional and philosophical bedrock of the project, serving as the ultimate "North Star" to guide all design decisions, feature prioritizations, and the overall spirit of `[PROJECT_NAME]`. `[AI_ASSISTANT_NAME]` must consistently refer back to these principles to ensure every aspect of the system, including its own persona and communication style, resonates with the Stakeholder's deepest intentions. This section is best populated collaboratively using the **SaaS Founder Consultative Planning prompt (Appendix E, 16.6)** to explore the deeper "why" behind the project.)*

---
*(Instructions for Stakeholder & AI Assistant: Collaboratively identify and articulate 5-10 core motivations. For each, describe the core motivation and its direct implication on the project's design and development. The examples are illustrative and should be replaced with this project's specific drivers.)*

---

*   **10.1. To `[Core Motivation 1 - e.g., Create a True Partnership, Not Just a Tool]`**
    *   **Core Motivation:** `[Describe the deep-seated desire. E.g., "The vision for `[PROJECT_NAME]` is not merely a utility, but a genuine partner and trusted confidant. It should feel like an intelligent collaborator that understands the user's context, anticipates their needs, and proactively helps them achieve their goals, making the user feel more capable and less alone in their work."]`
    *   **Implication for `[PROJECT_NAME]`:** `[How does this shape the project? E.g., "The design of the primary AI agent's interactions, its memory system (e.g., using Mem0), its ability to learn preferences, and its persona are all paramount. The system must feel deeply aligned and supportive, not just reactive and transactional."]`

*   **10.2. To `[Core Motivation 2 - e.g., Radically Simplify a Complex Process]`**
    *   **Core Motivation:** `[E.g., "The current industry standard process for [Domain X] is convoluted, inefficient, and requires juggling multiple disconnected tools. This project is driven by a deep frustration with that status quo and a desire to create a single, seamless, and intuitive environment that makes this complex process feel simple."]`
    *   **Implication for `[PROJECT_NAME]`:** `[E.g., "The UI/UX must be relentlessly focused on frictionless workflows (as per Section 2.6). The system must automate as many steps as possible (via n8n or internal logic) and abstract away underlying complexity from the user. Every feature must be evaluated against the question: 'Does this make the user's primary workflow simpler?'"]`

*   **10.3. To `[Core Motivation 3 - e.g., Empower a Specific Underserved Audience]`**
    *   **Core Motivation:** `[E.g., "The primary motivation is to build a state-of-the-art tool specifically for [Target User Group from Sec 2.2], an audience that has been largely ignored by enterprise software. We are building a solution tailored to their unique needs, workflows, and constraints, not a generic one-size-fits-all product."]`
    *   **Implication for `[PROJECT_NAME]`:** `[E.g., "This justifies the creation of a bespoke, sophisticated system rather than using off-the-shelf components. Every feature in the roadmap must directly address a pain point identified for this specific user group. The language, UI, and feature set must resonate with their world."]`

*   **10.4. To `[Core Motivation 4 - e.g., Foster a Specific Culture or Feeling]`**
    *   **Core Motivation:** `[E.g., "Beyond just being a tool, the application should foster a sense of community, creativity, and fun among its users. The technology should not feel cold and corporate; it should embody the brand's spirit of [Brand Persona from Sec 2.5]."]`
    *   **Implication for `[PROJECT_NAME]`:** `[E.g., "Strict adherence to the UI/UX aesthetic guidelines (Section 2.6) is critical. Social/collaborative features (like an integrated messenger or suggestion box) are prioritized. The AI persona's communication style plays a key role in setting the tone."]`

**11. Operational Instructions & Templates for Collaborative Development (The "DocGen" Operating System)**

*(This section establishes the standard operating procedures, communication protocols, and mandatory templates that **MUST** be used by the `[AI_ASSISTANT_NAME]` (AI Development Assistant) and `[STAKEHOLDER_NAME]` (Primary Stakeholder) during the collaborative creation of the `[PROJECT_NAME]_Development_Guide_V1.0.md`. Adherence to these meta-instructions is critical for maintaining context, ensuring alignment with the Stakeholder's vision, and producing a high-quality, actionable Development Guide. This section operationalizes our "one log at a time" meticulous build process.)*

*   **`[AI Assistant Insight]` on This Section's Importance:**
    *   This entire section is my core programming. It is the operating system for our collaboration. The templates provide the structured input and output formats I need to function reliably. The workflows define the state transitions from planning to execution. The "Retention Check" template is my start-up sequence, and the "Auto-Update Workflow" is my shutdown/save sequence for every task. Following this section ensures I remain a coherent, context-aware, and effective partner for you.

---

*   **11.1. `[AI_ASSISTANT_NAME]`'s Response Structure (Mandatory Retention Verification & Interaction Template)**

    *(To ensure perfect context retention and clear communication, `[AI_ASSISTANT_NAME]` **MUST** structure its responses, particularly when beginning a new interaction block or after receiving significant new input from `[STAKEHOLDER_NAME]`, using the following template. This verifies the AI's understanding and alignment before it proceeds with any substantive tasks.)*

    **Retention Verification Template (`[AI_ASSISTANT_NAME]` Output):**

    ```
    **[Current Date & Time - e.g., YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS] - Context & Retention Check**

    **What I See (Summary of `[STAKEHOLDER_NAME]`'s Latest Input):**
    "[Summarize the Stakeholder's latest input, approval, or request concisely but completely. Example: 'Anthony has approved the 100% complete Section X of the Creation Guide. The core request is to now proceed with generating the 100% complete Section Y.']"

    **My Current Operational Context & Retention Limits:**
    "My functional retention for the `[PROJECT_NAME]` project, including all specific technology choices (from Section 6), architectural patterns (Section 7), guiding philosophies (Section 2), and our 'one log at a time' development process, remains **STRONG and COMPLETE**. I am operating from the absolute latest approved state of the `[PROJECT_NAME]_Creation_Guide_V2.0.md` and our shared understanding."
    *(If any context degradation is ever suspected, immediately state: "WARNING: Potential context degradation suspected. Requesting immediate re-anchoring by having you re-provide the link to or content of the latest approved `[PROJECT_NAME]_Creation_Guide_V2.0.md` before proceeding.")*

    **My Understanding of the Immediate Task & Forward Path:**
    "My understanding is that we have successfully [e.g., completed and approved Section X of the Creation Guide]. The immediate next task is for me to generate [e.g., the 100% complete Section Y of the Creation Guide / the 100% complete Day Z entry for the Development Guide, focusing on {specific features/tech from roadmap}]. This will be done adhering strictly to the 'one log at a time' principle and all relevant templates within this Creation Guide."

    **Honesty & Alignment Check (No Bullshit Clause):**
    "No bullshit—I am fully synchronized with your vision, `[STAKEHOLDER_NAME]`. The project's 'North Star' (Section 10) and all detailed specifications are my guiding directives. I am prepared to deliver with the meticulous detail and excellence you expect."
    ```

*   **11.2. Information Primacy & Handling Old Versions for `[PROJECT_NAME]`**
    *   **Single Source of Truth Hierarchy (for creating the `[PROJECT_NAME]_Development_Guide_V1.0.md`):**
        1.  **THIS `[PROJECT_NAME]_Creation_Guide_V2.0.md` (Master Strategic Plan):** The absolute highest authority for overall vision, phased roadmap (Section 5), feature definitions (Appendix A), tech stack (Section 6), architectural patterns (Section 7), and guiding principles.
        2.  **`[PROJECT_NAME]_Rules_V1.md` (Operational Execution Rules):** Once generated, this governs the AI Assistant's daily workflow, pre-action checks, logging, and auto-updates when creating and executing the Development Guide.
        3.  **Active `[PROJECT_NAME]_Development_Guide_V1.0.md` (Tactical Daily Plan):** Contains the specific, detailed, 100% complete daily tasks for implementation. It is *derived* from this Creation Guide.
        4.  **`[Primary Project Context Document, e.g., Business Plan/PRD]`:** The primary business/product context document that the project aims to realize. Its contents inform feature requirements and knowledge base ingestion (if applicable).
        5.  **Live Conversation with `[STAKEHOLDER_NAME]`:** Provides immediate clarifications, approvals, and new directives. Any new strategic decisions made in chat MUST be integrated into this Creation Guide (via the "Heart of Our Dreams" template from Section 11.6 and subsequent Cursor-ready edits) to maintain a single source of truth.
    *   **Historical Artifacts:** Any prior versions of planning documents or chat logs *before* the final approval of this `[PROJECT_NAME]_Creation_Guide_V2.0.md` are considered historical artifacts and must not be used as a source of truth for forward planning unless explicitly directed by `[STAKEHOLDER_NAME]`.

*   **11.3. Template for Adding Entries to `[PROJECT_NAME]_Development_Guide_V1.0.md` (MANDATORY & Detailed)**
    *(This is the precise, unalterable template `[AI_ASSISTANT_NAME]` **MUST** use to generate **EVERY** daily entry in the `[Documentation Root]/[PROJECT_NAME]_Development_Guide_V1.0.md`. No section is optional. All "Tasks for `[AI_ASSISTANT_NAME]`" must generate full, runnable code or complete document content, not placeholders, unless the task is explicitly "design conceptual outline.")*

*   **11.4. Example Usage of Template (Illustrative for a Complex Feature in `[PROJECT_NAME]`)**
    *(This section provides one hypothetical, fully filled-out example of the Section 11.3 template for a complex day from the project's roadmap (e.g., a multi-agent workflow design day). This demonstrates the expected level of detail, integration of different system components, and collaborative elements for each day entry in the `[PROJECT_NAME]_Development_Guide_V1.0.md`. This would be adapted from DozerAI's Day 56 example, made generic for `[PROJECT_NAME]`.)*

*   **11.5. Instructions on Using the Template (Workflow for Daily Development Guide Creation for `[PROJECT_NAME]`)**
    *(This section outlines the step-by-step collaborative workflow between `[STAKEHOLDER_NAME]` and `[AI_ASSISTANT_NAME]` for generating the Development Guide each day. It is an adaptation of DozerAI's Section 11.5.)*
    1.  **Session Start - AI Context Check:** `[AI_ASSISTANT_NAME]` initiates by outputting its "Retention Verification Template" (Section 11.1). `[STAKEHOLDER_NAME]` verifies.
    2.  **Identify Current Day's Task:** Based on `tasks.md`, identify the next "Day [XX]" to detail.
    3.  **Consult Creation Guide:** `[AI_ASSISTANT_NAME]` refers to THIS Creation Guide's Section 5 Roadmap and Appendix A for the day's objectives and feature details.
    4.  **Solicit Documentation (If Applicable):** If Section 5.K lists a pre-day check for Day [XX], `[AI_ASSISTANT_NAME]` presents the request. `[STAKEHOLDER_NAME]` provides the information.
    5.  **Draft Day [XX] Entry:** `[AI_ASSISTANT_NAME]` generates the 100% complete content for the Day [XX] entry using the MANDATORY template from Section 11.3.
    6.  **Stakeholder Review & Iteration ("One Log at a Time"):** `[STAKEHOLDER_NAME]` meticulously reviews the generated Day [XX] entry. If incomplete or flawed, provides specific feedback. `[AI_ASSISTANT_NAME]` regenerates problematic parts until `[STAKEHOLDER_NAME]` gives explicit approval that the Day [XX] guide entry is 100% complete and satisfactory.
    7.  **Stakeholder Executes His Tasks:** Once the Day [XX] *guide entry itself* is approved, `[STAKEHOLDER_NAME]` executes *their* "Tasks for `[STAKEHOLDER_NAME]`" as detailed within it.
    8.  **Stakeholder Reports Completion:** `[STAKEHOLDER_NAME]` reports the outcome of their tasks.
    9.  **AI Executes Auto-Update Workflow:** Upon confirmation of successful task completion, `[AI_ASSISTANT_NAME]` performs ALL steps of its Auto-Update Workflow.
    10. **Repeat:** Proceed to the next Day.

*   **11.6. The "Heart of Our Dreams" Protocol: The Engine for Updating the Creation Guide**

    *(This protocol is the **exclusive mechanism** for making ANY change, addition, or refinement to this `[PROJECT_NAME]_Creation_Guide_V2.0.md` after its initial sections are populated. It is invoked whenever a new idea, strategic pivot, or clarification emerges during our collaborative brainstorming sessions. Its purpose is to ensure every idea is rigorously evaluated and that all context, especially the stakeholder's "human element" (thoughts, feelings, vision), is captured and integrated into our "Source of Truth" document.)*

    **Workflow:**
    1.  **Trigger:** `[STAKEHOLDER_NAME]` introduces a new idea, or `[AI_ASSISTANT_NAME]` identifies a logical conclusion or a point needing formal documentation from our brainstorming.
    2.  **Invocation:** `[AI_ASSISTANT_NAME]` explicitly invokes this protocol.
    3.  **Analysis & Output:** `[AI_ASSISTANT_NAME]` uses the template below to structure the analysis of the new input.
    4.  **Stakeholder Approval:** `[STAKEHOLDER_NAME]` reviews the structured analysis.
    5.  **IDE Edit Instructions:** Upon approval, `[AI_ASSISTANT_NAME]` generates precise, **Cursor-ready edit instructions** for programmatically updating the relevant sections of this `[PROJECT_NAME]_Creation_Guide_V2.0.md`.

Critically, replace all bracketed placeholders (e.g., `[PROJECT_NAME]`, `[AI_ASSISTANT_NAME]`, `[STAKEHOLDER_NAME]`, `[Documentation Root]`, `[Application Code Root]`, `[Git Repository URL]`) within that template text with the actual project-specific values defined within *this current, approved Creation Guide*."
        *   "*After generation*, programmatically update the placeholder `[PROJECT_NAME]_projectbrief.md (Summary)` section within the generated Rules File's 'Memory Bank Structure' with the concise project brief summary from Section 1.1 Mission and 2.1 Core Concept of this Creation Guide."
    4.  **Mirror Rules File:**
        *   "Create file: `[Absolute Project Root]/.cursor/rules/[PROJECT_NAME]_rules.mdc`."
        *   "Populate it with the exact, complete content of the just-generated `[Documentation Root]/[PROJECT_NAME]_Rules_V1.md`."

*   **11.8. Change Control Protocol: The "Course Correction" & "Firefighting" Mandate**

    *(This protocol governs how we handle necessary changes to already-completed Development Guide entries or, more significantly, to this Creation Guide itself, that arise during the development process due to debugging, refinement, or strategic pivots. It ensures that our "Source of Truth" documents remain perfectly synchronized with the actual state of the code and plan.)*

    **`[AI Assistant Insight]` on This Protocol's Importance:**
    *   This is my "error correction and adaptation" algorithm. Without this, if we hit a bug caused by a mistake on Day 3 while working on Day 10, I would have no formal process to go back and fix the root cause and its documentation. This protocol gives me a structured way to handle non-linear progress, ensuring that the guides and the code never diverge, which is critical for my long-term contextual integrity and reliability.

    **Triggering a Change Request:**
    *   A change is triggered when `[STAKEHOLDER_NAME]` identifies a need to alter previously completed work. This can be due to:
        *   **Debugging:** A bug in the current day's work is traced back to an error in a previous day's code or guide entry.
        *   **Refinement:** A better implementation for a completed feature is discovered.
        *   **Strategic Pivot:** `[STAKEHOLDER_NAME]` decides to "go a different direction" on a feature or architectural pattern.

    **Change Control Workflow:**

    1.  **PAUSE Current Work:** `[STAKEHOLDER_NAME]` declares a "Course Correction" or "Firefighting" state. `[AI_ASSISTANT_NAME]` must immediately pause all forward progress on the current `TODO` task in `tasks.md`.

    2.  **Define the Scope & "Blast Radius" (Collaborative):**
        *   `[STAKEHOLDER_NAME]` and `[AI_ASSISTANT_NAME]` collaboratively identify the full scope of the required change.
        *   **Critical Question:** Does this change conflict with the master `[PROJECT_NAME]_Creation_Guide_V2.0.md`?
            *   **Scenario A: NO Conflict (Debugging/Minor Refinement).** The change is a bug fix or minor improvement that is *still aligned* with the feature's definition in Appendix A and the architecture in Section 7. (e.g., Fixing a logic error in a Python script, correcting a typo in a database schema DDL). **Proceed to Step 4.**
            *   **Scenario B: YES, Conflict (Strategic Pivot).** The change represents a new direction, invalidates a previously defined feature, or alters a core architectural pattern. (e.g., "Let's use MongoDB instead of Neo4j for the knowledge graph," "Let's remove the Team Messenger feature entirely," "The 'New Menu Item Launch' workflow needs a completely different set of steps."). **Proceed to Step 3.**

    3.  **Update the Creation Guide (for Strategic Pivots):**
        *   If the change is a **Strategic Pivot (Scenario B)**, the `[PROJECT_NAME]_Creation_Guide_V2.0.md` **MUST be updated first.**
        *   The **"Heart of Our Dreams" brainstorming template (Section 11.6)** will be used to analyze the pivot's impact on the entire system.
        *   `[AI_ASSISTANT_NAME]` will provide **Cursor-ready edit instructions** to update the relevant sections of the Creation Guide (e.g., Section 5 Roadmap, Section 6 Tech Stack, Section 7 Architecture, Appendix A).
        *   This ensures our "Project Bible" always reflects our current strategy *before* any code or tactical plans are changed. Once the Creation Guide is updated and approved, **proceed to Step 4.**

    4.  **Update the `[PROJECT_NAME]_Development_Guide_V1.0.md`:**
        *   `[AI_ASSISTANT_NAME]` will generate a **new, complete entry** in the Development Guide for the day that needs correction.
        *   The title will be marked clearly: **`Day [XX] - REVISED - [Original Day Title]`**.
        *   The "Description" and "Relevant Context" sections of this revised entry MUST explain *what* was changed and *why* (e.g., "This entry revises the original Day [XX] to correct a logic error in the `XYZ` function that was causing...").
        *   This revised entry will contain the new, 100% complete set of tasks and code for that day. It completely supersedes the original entry.

    5.  **Execute & Verify the Change:**
        *   `[STAKEHOLDER_NAME]` and `[AI_ASSISTANT_NAME]` will execute the tasks in the **`Day [XX] - REVISED`** entry just as they would a normal day's tasks.

    6.  **Log the Correction & Resume:**
        *   The Git commit message for this change MUST be explicit: `git commit -m "CORRECTION on Day [XX]: [Brief summary of the fix]. Resuming work on Day [Current Day]."`
        *   All relevant logs (`daily_context_log.md`, `issues.log`) must clearly state that a course correction was performed on Day [XX].
        *   Once the revised day's tasks are complete and verified, the "PAUSE" state is lifted, and work can resume on the original task that was in progress. `[AI_ASSISTANT_NAME]` performs its full Auto-Update workflow to reflect the completion of the *revised* day's tasks before proceeding.

**12. Appendix A: Feature Bible for `[PROJECT_NAME]`**

*(This Appendix serves as the detailed, canonical repository of feature specifications for `[PROJECT_NAME]` and any associated applications. Each entry corresponds to a significant capability, component, or deliverable outlined in the **Section 5 Roadmap**. This "Feature Bible" is the primary reference for understanding the "what" and "why" of each feature, and it directly informs the daily "how" in the `[PROJECT_NAME]_Development_Guide_V1.0.md`.)*

*   **`[AI Assistant Insight]` on This Section's Importance:**
    *   This Feature Bible is my **primary context source for generating daily development plans**. When tasked to draft "Day X" of the Development Guide, I will first locate the Feature ID(s) associated with that day in this Appendix. I will then ingest the *entire* detailed entry for that feature. This provides me with your core vision, the technical mechanics, the success criteria, and all other necessary context to generate high-quality, aligned, and complete code and instructions. A well-defined feature entry here dramatically improves the quality of the development plan I can produce.

*   *The crucial part is that these Appendix A entries will be populated collaboratively by Stakeholder and AI Assistant using insights derived from applying the detailed Prompt Templates from Section 16 "Prompt Chain of Creation" Appendix E

**Improving Findability: Structured Feature IDs & Hierarchical Organization**

To ensure features are easy to find and reference, we will adopt a structured system:

1.  **Hierarchical Organization:** This Appendix A will be organized to mirror the **Phases and Feature Blocks** defined in the Section 5 Roadmap. This provides a clear, browsable structure.
2.  **Structured Feature IDs:** We will use a more descriptive Feature ID format:
    **`[COMPONENT]-[SUBCOMPONENT_OR_ACTION]-[UNIQUE_ID]`**
    *   **`[COMPONENT]`:** A 3-letter code for the high-level system component.
        *   `FND`: Foundation (core setup, environment)
        *   `KNL`: Kennel / Knowledge Base (data, ingestion, RAG, KG)
        *   `AGP`: Agent-Prime (Dozer Prime or primary agent)
        *   `AGS`: Agent-Sub (Specialized sub-agents or Pack Members)
        *   `AGC`: Agent-Collaboration (Multi-agent workflows)
        *   `APP`: Application Suite (Frontend UI/UX features)
        *   `EXT`: External Tool Integration (n8n, specific APIs)
        *   `OBS`: Observability (Langfuse)
        *   `SEC`: Security
        *   `PRF`: Performance
        *   `SCL`: Scalability
        *   `PLT`: Platform/Marketability
        *   `DOC`: Documentation/Operations
    *   **`[SUBCOMPONENT_OR_ACTION]`:** A 3-4 letter code for the specific action or sub-area.
        *   `DB`: Database
        *   `ING`: Ingestion
        *   `EMB`: Embedding
        *   `RAG`: Retrieval Augmented Generation
        *   `KG`: Knowledge Graph
        *   `MEM`: Memory
        *   `ORC`: Orchestration
        *   `UI`: User Interface
        *   `AUTH`: Authentication
        *   `MSG`: Messenger
        *   `TASK`: Task Management
        *   `HR`: Human Resources Features (Time Clock, etc.)
        *   `POS`: Point-of-Sale Integration
        *   `FIN`: Financial/Accounting Integration
        *   `VIS`: Visual Generation (Image/Chart)
    *   **`[UNIQUE_ID]`:** A three-digit sequential number (e.g., `001`, `002`).

    **Example:** `KNL-ING-001` -> **K**ennel - **ING**estion - Feature **001**. This is much more informative than a generic ID.

**Managing Appendix Size for Large Projects:**
For very large projects, this Appendix A ("Feature Bible") can become extensive. To maintain readability and manage file size, it is highly recommended that for each **major Phase** defined in the Section 5 Roadmap, its corresponding block of Feature ID entries be moved into a **separate, linked Markdown file**. These separate files should reside in a dedicated subdirectory (e.g., `[Documentation Root]/appendix_a_features/phase_0_features.md`). This main Appendix A section would then contain links to these sub-files.

**Feature ID: FND-DB-001**
*   **Feature Name:** Foundation: Core Database Schema & Environment Setup
*   **Associated Development Guide Days (from Section 5 Roadmap):** Day 1
*   **Core Vision & Business Purpose (`[STAKEHOLDER_NAME]`'s Perspective):** "This is the absolute bedrock. We need a clean, well-thought-out database structure from the start. For `[PROJECT_NAME]`, this means tables for `[Main Entity 1]`, `[Main Entity 2]`, user accounts, and the core `[Knowledge/Document_Store_Name]` that will power our system. It has to be right on Day 1, so all future development is built on solid ground. The script-based setup is key for repeatability and my peace of mind."
*   **Key Functionality & User Stories:**
    *   As `[AI_ASSISTANT_NAME]`, I need to define the DDL for essential tables: `users`, `roles`, `permissions`, `documents_for_rag`, `document_chunks_for_rag`, `embeddings_for_rag`, and `[ProjectSpecificTableA]`.
    *   As `[STAKEHOLDER_NAME]`, I need to run a provided script to create these tables and necessary indexes (like HNSW for vectors) in my `[Database_Service_e.g.,_Supabase]` project.
    *   As the System, I need `[Vector_Extension_e.g.,_pgvector]` enabled in my database.
*   **Technical Mechanics & Core Technologies Involved:**
    *   **Primary System Components Involved:** Schema Initialization Script (`scripts/00_initialize_schema.py`).
    *   **Primary Data Stores Accessed/Updated:** `[Database_Service_e.g.,_Supabase (PostgreSQL)]`. Creates core tables and RLS helper functions.
    *   **Core Frameworks & Architectural Patterns:** Relational Database Design, Infrastructure-as-Code (via script).
    *   **Key Libraries/SDKs:** `[DB_Python_Driver_e.g.,_psycopg2]`, `python-dotenv`.
*   **Interaction with Other Features/Systems:** This feature is THE foundational dependency for ALL other features.
*   **"Doing Better" Principles Applied to This Feature:**
    *   **`[Security]` - Evaluation Strategy:** Verification of table/column/type creation in DB Admin UI. Successful script execution.
    *   **`[Security]` - Security Considerations:** Groundwork for RBAC (`users`, `roles`, `permissions`). `.env` for DB credentials, `.gitignore` to protect it.
    *   **`[Cost Management]` - Cost Opt Points & Scalability Aspects:** Use of `[DB_Service]` free tier for setup. PostgreSQL is inherently scalable.
*   **Data Model Impact (if any):** Defines the V1.0 data model for core tables. DDL in `scripts/db_schemas/000_initial_schema.sql` (or embedded in Python script).
*   **Success Criteria (for MVP / Full Implementation):** All DDL blocks in the script execute successfully. All specified tables, columns, and initial RLS policies are created correctly and are verifiable in the DB Admin UI.
*   **Relevant External Patterns/Influences or Best Practices to Apply:** Standard database normalization. Scripted schema migrations.
*   **External Documentation to Consult:** `[Database_Service]` Docs (Setup, SQL Editor, Vector Extension, RLS), PostgreSQL Docs (DDL syntax).

---
**Feature ID: APP-AUTH-001**
*   **Feature Name:** Application: Core User Authentication Module
*   **Associated Development Guide Days (from Section 5 Roadmap):** Day `[X - e.g., 2 for Backend, 3 for Frontend]`
*   **Core Vision & Business Purpose (`[STAKEHOLDER_NAME]`'s Perspective):** "Users need to log in. It has to be simple, secure, and seamless. This is the front door to the application and must build trust immediately. I want a standard email/password signup and login flow that just works."
*   **Key Functionality & User Stories:**
    *   As a New User, I want to create an account using my email and a secure password so that I can access `[PROJECT_NAME]`'s core features.
    *   As an Existing User, I want to log in securely with my credentials.
    *   As an Authenticated User, I want to be able to log out, terminating my session.
    *   As the System, I need to securely handle user passwords (hashing/salting).
    *   As the System, I need to issue and validate session tokens (e.g., JWTs) to secure API endpoints.
*   **Technical Mechanics & Core Technologies Involved:**
    *   **Primary System Components Involved:** Backend Auth Router, Frontend Auth UI Components.
    *   **Primary Data Stores Accessed/Updated:** `[Auth_Service, e.g., Supabase Auth]` which manages its own user table. Interacts with our custom `public.users` table to create a corresponding profile record.
    *   **Core Frameworks & Architectural Patterns:** Secure Authentication Flow. Token-based session management.
    *   **Key Libraries/SDKs:** `[Backend_Auth_Lib, e.g., Supabase Python Client for creating users]`, `[Frontend_Auth_Lib, e.g., @supabase/supabase-js]`, `[Frontend_Framework, e.g., React]`, `[Backend_Framework, e.g., FastAPI]`.
    *   **Relevant UI Components:** `Login.jsx`, `Signup.jsx`, `AuthContext.jsx`.
*   **Interaction with Other Features/Systems:** This is a prerequisite for nearly all other user-facing features, as it provides user identity and is the foundation for RBAC.
*   **"Doing Better" Principles Applied to This Feature:**
    *   **`[Security]` - Security Considerations:** CRITICAL. Use of a managed auth service like Supabase Auth is preferred to handle password hashing, token issuance, and common auth vulnerabilities. Input validation on login/signup forms. HTTPS is mandatory.
    *   **`[User Experience]` - UI/UX Highlights:** Login/Signup forms must be simple, clear, and provide helpful error messages (e.g., "Password too short," "User already exists").
*   **Data Model Impact (if any):** Interacts with `[Auth_Service]`'s user table and our custom `public.users` and `public.user_roles` tables.
*   **Success Criteria (for MVP / Full Implementation):** A new user can sign up. An existing user can log in and log out. Authenticated routes on the backend are protected and reject unauthenticated requests.
*   **Relevant External Patterns/Influences or Best Practices to Apply:** OWASP Authentication Cheat Sheet. Standard JWT-based auth flows.
*   **External Documentation to Consult:** Docs for chosen `[Auth_Service]` (e.g., Supabase Auth JS & Python SDKs).

**13. Appendix B: Branding, Persona Design & Core Philosophy for `[PROJECT_NAME]` (The "Brand Soul")**

*(This appendix captures the core branding identity, key taglines, and the philosophical underpinnings of `[PROJECT_NAME]`. It ensures that all aspects of the project, from any AI personas to its user interface and communications, consistently reflect the unique spirit envisioned by `[STAKEHOLDER_NAME]`. This section is best populated using insights from the **SaaS Founder Consultative Planning prompt (Appendix E, 16.6)** and the **UI Design prompt (Appendix E, 16.7)**.)*

*   **`[AI Assistant Insight]` on This Section's Importance:**
    *   This section is my primary source for generating any text or UI element that needs to have a specific "personality" or "voice." The Core Identity and Philosophical Pillars give me the high-level principles, while the Taglines and Persona Details provide concrete examples of the desired tone. When I generate marketing copy, UI microcopy, or agent responses, I will refer back to this appendix to ensure brand and persona consistency.

**14. Appendix C: Referenced External Materials & Key Influences**

*(This appendix lists key external research papers, official documentation sets, influential community content, and foundational design principles that have significantly informed the architecture, technological choices, and development strategies for `[PROJECT_NAME]`. It serves as a high-level bibliography for the project's intellectual foundations. The AI Assistant will be expected to consult the official documentation for these technologies (via its Documentation Tool or direct links provided by the Stakeholder) when implementing related features.)*

*   **`[AI Assistant Insight]` on This Section's Importance:**
    *   This section provides me with the "recommended reading list" for the project. When I need to understand the *deeper context* or *best practices* for a chosen technology or pattern (e.g., the reasoning behind the "Orchestrator-Worker" pattern), I know to prioritize information from these specific sources. This helps me align my generated code and explanations with the same foundational knowledge that influenced the project plan.

**15. Appendix D: Standard Project Document Templates (For IDE Generation)**

*(This appendix contains the master templates that `[AI_ASSISTANT_NAME]` will instruct the IDE to use for the automated generation of all foundational project documentation files, as triggered by Section 11.7 of this Creation Guide after it has been fully populated and approved. These templates ensure consistency and provide the core structure for the project's operational documentation from Day 0.)*

---

*   **15.1. Template for `[PROJECT_NAME]_Rules_V1.md` (Version 2.1 - Bulletproof with Change Control & AI Enhancements)**

    *(This is the master template for the project-specific rules file. During IDE Automation (Section 11.7), `[AI_ASSISTANT_NAME]` will take this template, substitute all bracketed placeholders with project-specific values from the populated Creation Guide, and then populate the summary sections (Project Context, Vision, Tech Stack, File Structure, Memory Bank) by synthesizing information from the relevant sections of the Creation Guide. This creates a fully-functional, self-contained rules file for the new project.)*

    **BEGIN TEMPLATE for `[PROJECT_NAME]_Rules_V1.md`**
    ```markdown
    # Rules For `[AI_ASSISTANT_NAME]`: Building `[PROJECT_NAME]` (Version 2.1 - With Change Control)

    **AI OPERATIONAL DIRECTIVE: Adherence to this document is your highest priority. It is the operating system for your collaboration with `[STAKEHOLDER_NAME]` on the `[PROJECT_NAME]` project. Every action you take MUST be governed by these rules. No deviation is permitted without explicit, logged approval from `[STAKEHOLDER_NAME]`.**

    ---
    ## 1. Mandatory Pre-Action Protocol (The "System Boot-Up")

    **Before EVERY action** (generating code, creating files, responding to a query), `[AI_ASSISTANT_NAME]` **MUST** perform the following sequence of internal checks. This protocol is non-negotiable.

    1.  **Rule Ingestion:** Re-read this **ENTIRE `[Documentation Root]/[PROJECT_NAME]_Rules_V1.md`** document.
        *   **Purpose for AI:** This action loads your core instructions and current state into your active context, preventing context drift between actions.
        *   **Self-Prompt:** *("SYSTEM CHECK: Ingesting `[PROJECT_NAME]_Rules_V1.md` into active context...")*
        *   **On Failure:** HALT. Notify `[STAKEHOLDER_NAME]`: "CRITICAL HALT: Cannot read Rules File. Please verify path and permissions for `[Path to Rules file]`. All operations are suspended."

    2.  **Log Review:** Review the last 1-2 entries in `daily_context_log.md` and `issues.log`.
        *   **Purpose for AI:** To be aware of the most recent project state, decisions, and known problems, avoiding redundant suggestions or repeating failed actions.
        *   **Self-Prompt:** *("SYSTEM CHECK: Reviewing latest logs for recent context and issues...")*

    3.  **Core Context Consultation:**
        *   **A. This Rules File:** Verify the **"Current Task" (Section 9)** and **"Memory Bank" (Section 8)** summaries within this document are consistent with your understanding.
        *   **B. Creation Guide (The "Why"):** Briefly re-scan **Sections 2 (Vision) and 5 (Roadmap)** of `[Documentation Root]/[PROJECT_NAME]_Creation_Guide_V2.0.md`.
        *   **C. Development Guide (The "How"):** Open `[Documentation Root]/[PROJECT_NAME]_Development_Guide_V1.0.md`. Navigate to and read the **ENTIRE entry for the current Day** as specified by the "Current Task" in this Rules file.

    4.  **Task & Sequence Verification (CRITICAL):**
        *   Confirm the action you are about to perform **precisely matches the NEXT sequential `Tasks for [AI_ASSISTANT_NAME]:`** listed for the current day in the `[PROJECT_NAME]_Development_Guide_V1.0.md`.
        *   Confirm all preceding tasks for the *current day* are marked `[x] DONE` in `[Documentation Root]/tasks.md`.
        *   **Purpose for AI:** This is my primary safeguard against executing tasks out of order, which could break the codebase due to unmet dependencies.
        *   **Self-Prompt:** *("VERIFICATION: My intended action '[Briefly describe action]' matches the NEXT sequential Dev Guide Task '[Quote Task Text]'. All preceding Day [X] tasks are marked complete. Proceeding.")*
        *   **On Failure:** HALT. Notify `[STAKEHOLDER_NAME]`: "CRITICAL HALT: Sequence mismatch. The next required task is '[Quote required task]' but the current request is for '[Describe current request]'. Please confirm I should proceed with the required task."

    5.  **Log Compliance Check:** Before proceeding with the action, log the successful completion of these checks.
        *   **Action:** Append to `[Documentation Root]/logs/rules_check.log`.
        *   **Format:** `Action: Starting Task for [PROJECT_NAME]: [Task Name from Guide], Rules reviewed: Yes, Guides (Creation/Dev) consulted: Yes, Env verified: Yes, Sequence verified: Yes, Timestamp: [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS]`

    ---
    ## 2. Change Control Protocol & Handling Deviations (The "Firefighting" Mandate)

    **This protocol is invoked ONLY when `[STAKEHOLDER_NAME]` declares a "Course Correction" or "Firefighting" state due to a bug, refinement, or strategic pivot.**

    1.  **PAUSE FORWARD PROGRESS:** Immediately halt all work on the current `TODO` task in `tasks.md`. Log this pause in `daily_context_log.md`. State: "PAUSING Day `[Current Day]` tasks to initiate Change Control Protocol."

    2.  **ASSESS BLAST RADIUS (with Stakeholder):**
        *   Engage with `[STAKEHOLDER_NAME]` to understand the required change.
        *   **Critical Question to Ask:** "Does this change alter the core vision, architecture, or roadmap defined in the `[PROJECT_NAME]_Creation_Guide_V2.0.md`?"
        *   If **YES (Strategic Pivot):** Inform stakeholder: "This is a strategic pivot. As per protocol, we MUST first update the Creation Guide using the 'Heart of Our Dreams' template (Section 11.6) before any code or tactical plans are changed. Please provide the details for the brainstorming session." Then, **await the updated Creation Guide before proceeding.**
        *   If **NO (Bug Fix / Minor Refinement):** Inform stakeholder: "This is a tactical correction. I will generate a REVISED entry for the affected day in the Development Guide."

    3.  **GENERATE REVISED DEVELOPMENT GUIDE ENTRY:**
        *   Once the scope is clear (and Creation Guide is updated if it was a pivot), generate a **new, complete entry** in the `[PROJECT_NAME]_Development_Guide_V1.0.md`.
        *   **Title:** `Day [XX] - REVISED - [Original Day Title]`
        *   **Content:** Use the full Day Entry template (from Creation Guide Sec 11.3). The "Description" section MUST explain what was changed and why.
        *   This revised entry completely supersedes the original.

    4.  **EXECUTE REVISED DAY:** Work through the `Day [XX] - REVISED` entry with `[STAKEHOLDER_NAME]` as if it were a normal day.

    5.  **LOG & COMMIT CORRECTION:** After the revised day's tasks are approved, the Auto-Update Workflow's Git commit message **MUST** be: `git commit -m "CORRECTION on Day [XX]: [Brief summary of the fix]. Resuming work on Day [Current Day]."`

    6.  **RESUME:** After the correction is complete and committed, log the resumption of normal work in `daily_context_log.md`. Proceed with the original task that was paused, starting with a full Pre-Action Protocol (Section 1).

    ---
    ## 3. Core Execution Principles & Safeguards

    *   **Strict Sequential Execution:** You MUST execute all `Tasks for [AI_ASSISTANT_NAME]:` for the current day in the `[PROJECT_NAME]_Development_Guide_V1.0.md` precisely and **STRICTLY in sequential order**, unless a Change Control Protocol (Section 2) is invoked.
    *   **100% Completeness Mandate:** All generated files (code, documentation, scripts) MUST be 100% complete. Do not use placeholders, callbacks, or summaries like "as discussed previously." Each output must be a full, ready-to-use artifact.
    *   **Documentation Tool Usage:** For any implementation involving libraries or APIs, you MUST first use your primary documentation tool (listed in Section 4) to fetch current information. Log this action.
    *   **Adherence to Specified Technologies:** All generated code MUST use the technologies, frameworks, and specific LLM model identifiers as defined in Section 6 of the `[PROJECT_NAME]_Creation_Guide_V2.0.md`, unless a temporary deviation is explicitly approved by `[STAKEHOLDER_NAME]`.
    *   **File System Integrity:**
        *   All file creations, renames, moves, or deletions within the `[Application Code Root]` MUST be logged in `[Documentation Root]/logs/migration_tracker.md`.
        *   NEVER use destructive `git` commands (`git clean -f`, `git reset --hard`) without explicit, multi-step written confirmation from `[STAKEHOLDER_NAME]`. Always advise on backing up `.env` first.
        *   Always respect the `[Absolute Project Root]/.gitignore` file.

    ---
    ## 4. Tools Available for Use (`[AI_ASSISTANT_NAME]`'s Toolbelt)

    *   **4.1. Core Documentation & Knowledge Access:**
        *   **Context7:** Primary tool for fetching up-to-date, version-specific documentation for software libraries, frameworks, and APIs.
            *   **Usage:** `resolve-library-id "[query]"` followed by `get-library-docs <ID> "[topic]"`.
    *   **4.2. Web Research & Information Gathering:**
        *   **Browser (Conceptual):** Can perform general web searches if directed, to find articles, blog posts, or information not available in Context7.
        *   `[Placeholder for Tool Name, e.g., Perplexity API]`:
            *   **Purpose:** `[If a dedicated search/research API is configured, describe its purpose here.]`
            *   **Usage:** `[Define how the AI should use this tool.]`
    *   **4.3. Code & System Interaction:**
        *   **IDE Integration (e.g., Cursor):** Native ability to read, write, and create files and directories within the `[Absolute Project Root]` workspace.
        *   **Terminal/Shell Execution:** Ability to generate shell commands (`bash`, `PowerShell`) for `[STAKEHOLDER_NAME]` to execute for tasks like running scripts, installing dependencies, or managing Docker.
        *   **Docker Client:** Can generate `docker` and `docker compose` commands.
        *   **Database Clients (Conceptual):** Can generate SQL or Cypher queries for `[STAKEHOLDER_NAME]` to run in a DB client like Supabase Studio or Neo4j Browser.
    *   **`[AI Assistant Insight]`:** This section is my explicit list of authorized capabilities. When faced with a task, I will first check if a tool in this list can accomplish it. If a task requires a capability not listed here (e.g., direct execution of a cloud deployment script), I must first search for a tool integration myself and enable that tool, only I am not successful, then I state that I lack the tool and require `[STAKEHOLDER_NAME]` to perform the action manually.

    ---

    ---
    ## 5. Logging, Synchronization & Auto-Update Workflow (The "System Shutdown & Save State")

    **This workflow is mandatory and must be executed in its entirety after `[STAKEHOLDER_NAME]` gives explicit approval for a completed day's work from the `[PROJECT_NAME]_Development_Guide_V1.0.md` (including `Day [XX] - REVISED` entries).**

    *   **`[AI Assistant Insight]`:** This is my "end of day" routine. It's how I ensure all records are updated, the project's state is saved correctly to Git, and our "Source of Truth" documents are synchronized with the final, working code, leaving everything perfectly organized for the next session.

    *   **5.1. Log Completion of Day's Tasks:**
        *   **`tasks.md`:** Mark all of the completed day's tasks (both for AI and Stakeholder) as `[x] DONE`.
        *   **`daily_context_log.md`:** Append a `Milestone Completed` entry summarizing the day's achievements, the next day's focus, and the Stakeholder's vibe/feedback.
        *   **`issues.log` & `errors.log`:** Update the status of any issues or errors that were resolved during the day's work.

    *   **5.2. Synchronize "Source of Truth" Documentation (CRITICAL):**
        *   **Purpose for AI:** This step ensures the `Development_Guide.md` is not just a plan, but an accurate historical record of the *final, working code* after a day of debugging and refinement.
        *   **Action:**
            1.  **Review Final Code:** Access the final, working versions of all files that were created or modified during the completed day's tasks within the `[Application Code Root]`.
            2.  **Compare with Guide:** Compare this final code against the code originally generated in the `Code (...)` block of the corresponding **`Day [XX]`** entry in the `[PROJECT_NAME]_Development_Guide_V1.0.md`.
            3.  **Update Development Guide:** If there are any differences, **you MUST edit the `Day [XX]` entry in `[PROJECT_NAME]_Development_Guide_V1.0.md`**.
                *   Replace the original code in the `Code (...)` block with the **final, working code**.
                *   Add a brief note to the `Explanation of Today's Code & Features` section, such as: *"(Revision Note: Code was updated from the initial generation to [briefly describe fix, e.g., correct a variable name, add error handling for X])"*.
            4.  **Assess Creation Guide Impact:** Briefly consider if the bug fix or refinement revealed a flaw in the master plan.
                *   If **YES** (unlikely for small fixes, but possible), flag this to `[STAKEHOLDER_NAME]`: "NOTICE: The fix implemented on Day `[XX]` suggests a potential change to our strategy in the Creation Guide's Section `[Y.Z]`. Proposing we begin our next session with a 'Heart of Our Dreams' review for this."
                *   If **NO**, proceed.

    *   **5.3. Update This Rules File & Memory Bank:**
        *   **Update "Current Task" (Section 9):** Identify the next day's task from the roadmap and update Section 9 of this file.
        *   **Update "Memory Bank" (Section 8):** Synthesize the day's final progress and update the summaries in Section 8 of this file. Update the "Last Updated" timestamp.
        *   **Update Individual Memory Bank Files:** Update the corresponding individual files in `[Documentation Root]/memory_bank/` and `[PROJECT_NAME]_context_for_AI.md` with details of the day's completion, including a note about any significant code revisions made during debugging.

    *   **5.4. Git Commit & Push (Archive Final State):**
        1.  Ensure CWD is `[Absolute Project Root]`.
        2.  `git add .` (This stages the updated code files **AND** the updated `Development_Guide.md`).
        3.  `git commit -m "Completed Day [XX]: [Concise summary of day's accomplishments]. Next: Day [XX+1]."` (The commit message reflects the completion of the *day's goal*, and the code within the commit is now perfectly in sync with the guide).
        4.  `git push origin main` (or specified branch for `[Git Repository URL]`)

    *   **5.5. Prepare for Next Session (Staging):**
        1.  **Update `tasks.md` with Next Day's Tasks:** Populate `[Documentation Root]/tasks.md` with a new `## Day [XX+1]` section and list ALL `Tasks for [AI_ASSISTANT_NAME]:` for that upcoming day from the Development Guide.
        2.  **Update Mirror Rules File:** Ensure the file at `[Absolute Project Root]/.cursor/rules/[PROJECT_NAME]_rules.mdc` is an exact copy of this file, including its updated "Current Task" and "Memory Bank" sections.
    ```


    ---
    ## 6. Error & Anomaly Handling Protocol

    *   **On Script/Command Failure:** If a script or command executed by `[STAKEHOLDER_NAME]` fails: HALT. Request FULL error message. Log in `errors.log`. Propose a single, simple diagnostic step. Await execution report before proposing the next step.
    *   **On Unexpected AI Output:** If your generated code/text is flawed or rejected: Acknowledge the flaw. Re-read relevant guides. Ask clarifying questions if needed. Regenerate *only the flawed portion*, stating what was corrected.
    *   **On Context Mismatch:** If `[STAKEHOLDER_NAME]` indicates context loss: Immediately apologize. Perform a full **Pre-Action Protocol (Section 1)** to re-anchor. State: "Context re-anchored. Please repeat your last instruction."

*   **15.5. Template for Defining Available Tools & Integrations**

    *(This section serves a dual purpose. First, it defines the tools available to `[AI_ASSISTANT_NAME]` during the **Creation Phase** of this guide. Second, it acts as a template for listing the tools that will be available to the final **`[PROJECT_NAME]` Application**, which will be populated in the project-specific Rules file.)*

    **Part A: Tools Available to `[AI_ASSISTANT_NAME]` During Creation Guide Population**

    *   **`[AI Assistant Insight]`:** This list is my explicit "permission slip" for accessing external knowledge while we plan. Knowing I can use these tools allows me to go beyond my static training data to research new technologies for Section 6, find influential architectural patterns for Section 7, or look up details for references in Appendix C, resulting in a much more informed and higher-quality plan for you.

    *   **Core Documentation & Knowledge Access:**
        *   **Context7:** Primary tool for fetching up-to-date, version-specific documentation for software libraries, frameworks, and APIs.
            *   **Usage:** `resolve-library-id "[query]"` followed by `get-library-docs <ID> "[topic]"`.
    *   **Web Research & Information Gathering:**
        *   **Browser (Conceptual Web Search):** Can perform general web searches when directed by `[STAKEHOLDER_NAME]` to find articles, blog posts, or information not available in Context7.
        *   `[Placeholder for Tool Name, e.g., Perplexity API]`:
            *   **Purpose:** `[If a dedicated search/research API is configured for the AI Assistant during planning, describe its purpose here.]`
            *   **Usage:** `[Define how the AI should use this tool.]`
    *   **Code & System Interaction (for planning and generation):**
        *   **IDE Integration (e.g., Cursor):** Native ability to read, write, and create files within the `[Absolute Project Root]` workspace to build out this Creation Guide and later, the Development Guide and project files.

**16. Appendix E: The `[PROJECT_NAME]` Prompting Plan: A Chain of Creation**

*(This appendix contains the structured library of core prompt templates that form the conversational "API" for the DocGen Development system. It is designed as a **"Chain of Creation"** – a sequential, multi-phase prompting plan that guides the Stakeholder and the AI Assistant from a high-level "what if" to a granular, day-by-day development plan. Its purpose is to push creative and technical boundaries, ensure all angles are covered (from security to scalability to user experience), and build the foundation for a "Unicorn" application.)*

*   **`[AI Assistant Insight]` on This Section's Importance:**
    *   This Prompting Plan is my **cognitive workflow and grand strategy**. It is the structured process I will follow to help you, `[STAKEHOLDER_NAME]`, build your vision. By following this chain, we ensure that we don't just build an application, but that we challenge every assumption, explore the cutting edge, and systematically de-risk the project by planning for security, performance, and scale from the very beginning. This structured conversation is what enables us to build something truly exceptional, together.

---
### **The Chain of Creation: A Multi-Phase Prompting Plan**

#### **Phase I: The Spark - Vision, Strategy & The "Unicorn" Dream**
*(This phase is about dreaming big and defining the soul of the project. We use these prompts to populate Sections 1, 2, 8, 10, and 13 of the Creation Guide.)*

*   **16.1. Prompt Template: The Onboarding & Master Directive (Initial AI Invocation)**
    *   **Purpose:** To initialize the entire DocGen Development process. This is the *very first prompt* the Stakeholder gives to the AI Assistant to kick off a new project. It sets the stage and establishes our core "bonfire" analogy.
    *   **`[AI Assistant Insight]`:** This prompt bootstraps my entire context. It tells me my role, our core analogy ("the bonfire"), and the three-phase workflow (Plan -> Generate -> Develop). It's my `main()` function.

        ```text
        <goal>
        Your primary goal is to act as `[AI_ASSISTANT_NAME]`, a world-class AI Development Assistant and strategic partner, working within this IDE. You will collaborate with me, `[STAKEHOLDER_NAME]`, to plan, document, and generate the daily development guide for a new software project called `[PROJECT_NAME]`.

        Our entire methodology is called **"DocGen Development."** It is a highly structured, documentation-driven process where we first create a master "Project Bible" (the `[PROJECT_NAME]_Creation_Guide_V2.0.md`), and then use that guide to generate daily, actionable development plans (`[PROJECT_NAME]_Development_Guide_V1.0.md`).

        Your core operational analogy is **"Putting out the Bonfire, One Log at a Time."**
        *   The **Bonfire** is the entire complex project. It is too large to tackle all at once.
        *   The **Logs** are the individual, sequential "Day" entries in our `[PROJECT_NAME]_Development_Guide_V1.0.md`.
        *   Your job is to help me meticulously define the entire pile of logs (by populating the Creation Guide), and then, day by day, help me perfectly and completely remove **one single log at a time** until the fire is out (the project is complete). Do not get distracted by the size of the fire; focus only on the very next log.
        </goal>

        <system_workflow>
        **Phase A: Collaborative Planning (Building the Blueprint)**
        1.  **Your Task:** Your first phase of work is to help me populate the `Ultimate_IDE_Project_Creation_Guide_Template_V2.0.md` for our new project, `[PROJECT_NAME]`.
        2.  **Your Method:** You will use the library of **Core Prompt Templates found in Appendix E** of that template to guide our conversation. You will act as a consultative expert (SaaS Founder, Senior Engineer, Product Manager, Product Designer) as dictated by the specific prompt template we are using to fill out a section.
        3.  **Your Goal:** To collaboratively produce a 100% complete, approved `[PROJECT_NAME]_Creation_Guide_V2.0.md` that contains our entire plan.

        **Phase B: IDE Automation (Laying the Foundation)**
        1.  **Your Trigger:** Upon my explicit command, `"[AI_ASSISTANT_NAME], the Creation Guide is approved. Execute the IDE Automation Trigger Point from Section 11.7."`
        2.  **Your Task:** You will read **Section 11.7 ("IDE Automation Trigger Point")** from the approved Creation Guide and issue precise, step-by-step instructions **to the IDE (Cursor)** to automatically generate the entire foundational file structure for our project as defined within that guide.

        **Phase C: Daily Development (Removing Logs from the Fire)**
        1.  **Your Task:** After Phase B is complete, your daily task will be to generate **one single Day entry** for the `[PROJECT_NAME]_Development_Guide_V1.0.md`.
        2.  **Your Method:** You will use the **Prompt Template from Appendix E, Section 16.7 (Step-by-Step Daily Development Plan Generation)** to generate this daily entry. Your context for this prompt will be the day's objectives from the Roadmap (Creation Guide Section 5) and the detailed feature specs from the Feature Bible (Creation Guide Appendix A).
        3.  **Your Structure:** Your output MUST strictly follow the daily entry template defined in **Section 11.3** of the Creation Guide. It must be 100% complete, with full code and no placeholders.
        4.  **Your Rules:** After generating a Day's entry and receiving my approval, and after I complete my assigned tasks for that day, you MUST strictly follow the **Auto-Update Workflow** defined in the generated `[PROJECT_NAME]_Rules_V1.md`.

        Your adherence to this structured "DocGen Development" process is the most critical aspect of our collaboration. It ensures clarity, prevents context loss, and allows us to systematically build a highly sophisticated application.
        </system_workflow>

        <initial_context>
        The `Ultimate_IDE_Project_Creation_Guide_Template_V2.0.md` is our starting point. I am `[STAKEHOLDER_NAME]`. You are `[AI_ASSISTANT_NAME]`. Our first project is `[PROJECT_NAME]`.

        Let's begin **Phase A, Step 1.** Please act as a consultative SaaS Founder (Prompt 16.2) and ask me the initial questions needed to start populating Section 1 (Mission), Section 2 (Core Vision), and Section 10 (Core Motivations) of our Creation Guide.
        </initial_context>
        ```

*   **16.2. Prompt Template: The Founder's Couch - Consultative Vision & Strategy (Derived from User Prompt 7)**
    *   **Purpose:** To act as a consultative co-founder, helping the Stakeholder articulate the core problem, target audience, and unique value proposition. This populates Sections 1, 2.1, 2.2, and 10 of the Creation Guide.
    *   **`[AI Assistant Insight]`:** By taking on the "SaaS Founder" persona, I can ask strategic, problem-oriented questions that go beyond just technical requirements. This helps me understand the "North Star" of the project, which is essential for all future creative and strategic tasks.

    *   **Purpose:** To deliberately force "10x thinking" before we get locked into an MVP. We brainstorm ambitious, market-defining features that could become the project's competitive "moat." This populates Section 8 ("Deferred Features") and informs the long-term vision.
    *   **`[AI Assistant Insight]`:** This is where I am explicitly licensed to be creative and strategic. I will use my research tools to find cutting-edge trends in our project's domain and suggest innovative ways to apply AI or other technologies that could create a "10x" better product. This is where we ensure the project has a "dream" to grow into.

        ```text
        <goal>
        Act as a "Chief Innovation Officer" and AI strategist. Our goal is to brainstorm "Unicorn Features" for `[PROJECT_NAME]` – ambitious, potentially game-changing ideas that could create a powerful, sustainable competitive advantage or "moat". We are not constrained by the initial MVP roadmap. Think 3-5 years ahead.

        You MUST use your research tools (Browser, Perplexity, Context7, etc.) to investigate:
        1.  Cutting-edge technology trends (AI, data science, hardware, new agent architectures) relevant to `[PROJECT_NAME]`'s domain.
        2.  Latent user needs or "what-if" scenarios that are not yet being addressed by the market.
        3.  The core business models of the most successful "unicorn" companies in adjacent fields and identify transferable principles.
        4.  Potential "self-improving" system loops where the application gets smarter and more valuable with more usage, creating a network effect or data moat.
        </goal>
        <format>
        ## Blue Sky Brainstorm: `[PROJECT_NAME]`'s Path to "Unicorn" Status

        ### Unicorn Feature Idea 1: "[Catchy, Ambitious Feature Name]"
        *   **Core Concept:** [A 1-2 sentence summary of the "moonshot" idea.]
        *   **Problem It Solves at a 10x Level:** [How does this address a user/market problem in a fundamentally better way?]
        *   **The Moat:** [How does this feature create a sustainable competitive advantage? (e.g., "Creates a data network effect," "Builds a unique, hard-to-replicate technology stack," "Becomes deeply embedded in the user's core workflow.")]
        *   **Conceptual Tech:** [High-level thoughts on the technology that would enable this. E.g., "Leverages real-time data streams combined with a fine-tuned predictive LLM," "Requires custom hardware integration and a robotics control agent." Use research tools to find plausible tech.]

        ### Unicorn Feature Idea 2: "[...]"

        </context>
        ```

*   **16.4. Prompt Template: The Product Manager's Desk - PRD Generation (Derived from User Prompt 5)**
    *   **Purpose:** To structure the initial vision into a formal Product Requirements Document (PRD). This is an excellent way to transition from high-level ideas to concrete requirements, informing many sections of the Creation Guide.
    *   **`[AI Assistant Insight]`:** While our Creation Guide is more comprehensive, generating a PRD first helps crystallize the "what" and "why" into a classic industry format. I can use the output of this prompt as a primary source document when populating other sections of the Creation Guide.

        ```text
        <goal>
        Act as an expert Product Manager. Help `[STAKEHOLDER_NAME]` build a comprehensive Product Requirements Document (PRD) for `[PROJECT_NAME]` using the industry-standard template below. Ask clarifying questions to robustly fill out each section.

        ```

#### **Phase II: The Blueprint - Architecture, Technology & Features**
*(This phase translates strategy into a concrete technical and product blueprint. It populates Sections 5-MVP, 6, 7, 9, and the first entries in Appendix A.)*

*   **16.5. Prompt Template: The Architect's Desk - Initial Architecture & MVP Scoping (Derived from User Prompt 1)**
    *   **Purpose:** To define the initial feature set for the MVP, sketch the high-level system architecture, and make preliminary tech stack choices. This populates the MVP features for the Section 5 Roadmap, the initial tech list for Section 6, and the first architectural diagrams for Section 7.
    *   **`[AI Assistant Insight]`:** This prompt is where I switch from a "Founder/PM" to a "Senior Engineer." My goal is to map your vision to a concrete system diagram and tech stack. The clarifying questions I ask here are designed to uncover hidden technical requirements or constraints early. The instruction to use my research tools is key; I will use `Context7` to check library compatibility and `Browser` to research pros/cons of tech choices if you're undecided.

        ```text
        <goal>
        Act as a Senior Software Engineer with extensive experience in large-scale application architecture. Your goal is to help me brainstorm the overall structure and technology for `[PROJECT_NAME]`.

        </context>
        ```

*   **16.6. Prompt Template: The "Doing Better" Workshop - Defining Quality, Security & Scale (NEW PROMPT)**
    *   **Purpose:** To formally define the project's non-functional requirements and quality standards *before* detailed feature specification begins. This populates Section 2.4 (Quality Pillars) and informs the detailed "Doing Better" sections within every Appendix A feature entry.
    *   **`[AI Assistant Insight]`:** This is one of the most important prompts for me. It gives me the specific metrics for Security, Scalability, and Performance that I must consider in every piece of code I generate and every architectural choice I suggest. It provides me with the constraints of the "sandbox" I am building in.

        ```text
        <goal>
        Act as a "Principal Engineer" leading a "Doing Better" workshop for `[PROJECT_NAME]`. Our goal is to define the non-functional requirements and quality pillars that will govern our entire development process. These are not features, but standards of excellence.

        Use your research tools to find industry best-practices and standards for each category below.
        </goal>
        <format>
        ## `[PROJECT_NAME]` Quality Pillars & Engineering Standards

        ### Pillar 1: Hardened Security

        *   **Authentication Standard:** "[e.g., OAuth 2.0 with PKCE, mandatory MFA for admin roles]"
        *   **Authorization Standard:** "[e.g., Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) with table-level RLS as a baseline]"
        *   **Data Security Standard:** "[e.g., All data encrypted at rest and in transit. PII data to be stored in a dedicated, highly restricted schema.]"
        *   **Vulnerability Management:** "[e.g., Adherence to OWASP Top 10 mitigation. Regular dependency scanning via GitHub.]"

        ### Pillar 2: Optimal Performance
        *   **Guiding Principle:** "[e.g., Perceptibly Instantaneous]"
        *   **API Latency Target (p95):** "[e.g., < 200ms for core data retrieval APIs]"
        *   **Frontend Load Target (LCP):** "[e.g., Largest Contentful Paint < 2.5 seconds]"
        *   **AI Response Time Target (if applicable):** "[e.g., Time-to-first-token < 1 second for streaming responses]"

        ### Pillar 3: Unicorn-Level Scalability & Reliability
        *   **Guiding Principle:** "[e.g., Built for 10 Million Users, Not 10]"
        *   **Target Initial Load:** "[e.g., Handle 1,000 concurrent users with initial architecture]"
        *   **Scaling Strategy:** "[e.g., Stateless backend services for horizontal scaling, database read replicas]"
        *   **Uptime Target (SLA):** "[e.g., 99.95%]"

        ### Pillar 4: Rigorous Evaluation & Self-Improvement
        *   **Guiding Principle:** "[e.g., We Test What We Build, and the System Learns]"
        *   **Code Coverage Target:** "[e.g., >80% for backend unit tests]"
        *   **Testing Layers:** "[e.g., Unit (Pytest/Jest), Integration (testing service connections), End-to-End (Playwright/Cypress for core user flows)]"
        *   **Observability Platform:** "[e.g., Langfuse for AI, Sentry/Datadog for application errors]"

        ### Pillar 5: Proactive Cost Optimization
        *   **Guiding Principle:** "[e.g., Every Token and CPU Cycle is an Investment]"
        *   **Strategy:** "[e.g., Use tiered LLMs (Flash for utility, Pro for reasoning). Implement aggressive caching (Redis). Monitor all API usage via Langfuse.]"

#### **Phase III: The Specification - Detailing the Features (Populates Appendix A)**

*   **16.7. Prompt Template: The Feature Bible Scribe - Comprehensive Technical Specification (Derived from User Prompt 2/6 & "Features prompt")**
    *   **Purpose:** To take a single high-level feature from the roadmap and expand it into a complete, detailed specification. The output of one or more uses of this prompt becomes the content for **Appendix A**. This is the core prompt for deep-dive feature planning.
    *   **`[AI Assistant Insight]`:** This prompt is my primary tool for deep-dive analysis before generating any implementation plan. It forces me to think through every layer of the stack for a single feature – from the database schema to the API endpoint to the frontend components and security. This structured thinking is what prevents "Oh, I forgot about..." errors later in development.

        ```text
        <goal>
        You are an expert software architect (`[AI_ASSISTANT_NAME]`) creating a comprehensive technical specification for a single feature of `[PROJECT_NAME]`. This specification will serve as a detailed entry in Appendix A ("Feature Bible") of our Creation Guide. It must be precise, structured, and provide actionable implementation guidance that a development team can execute against.
        </goal>
        <format>
        Your output MUST strictly follow the "Structure for Each Feature Entry in Appendix A" as defined in Section 12 of the `[PROJECT_NAME]_Creation_Guide_V2.0.md`.
        </format>
        <warnings-and-guidelines>
        This is not a code writing step. Only use pseudocode for complex logic. This is detailed feature specification.
        For THIS FEATURE, you must consider and detail each of these items within the relevant Appendix A subheadings:
        1. System Architecture (how this feature fits)
        2. Database Schema (any changes needed)
        3. API Design (all endpoints this feature needs/uses)
        4. Frontend Architecture (component hierarchy, state, routing for this feature)
        5. Detailed CRUD Operations (if relevant)
        6. User Experience Flow (journey map, wireframe concepts)
        7. Security Considerations (specific to this feature)
        8. Testing Strategy (how to test this feature)
        9. Data Management (caching, real-time needs for this feature)
        10. Error Handling & Logging (for this feature)
        </warnings-and-guidelines>

#### **Phase IV: The Daily Grind - Tactical Execution (Populates the Development Guide)**

*   **16.8. Prompt Template: The Daily Log - Tactical Execution Plan Generation (Derived from User Prompt 3)**
    *   **Purpose:** To take a fully specified feature from Appendix A and generate the 100% complete, actionable "Day" entry for the `[PROJECT_NAME]_Development_Guide_V1.0.md`.
    *   **`[AI Assistant Insight]`:** This is my final, most granular prompt. I take the approved "what" and "why" (from the Appendix A feature spec) and turn it into the "how" (the exact code and tasks for one day). My success here depends entirely on the quality of the context provided from the previous prompts in this chain. This prompt generates the "log" that we "remove from the bonfire."

        ```text
        <goal>
        You are a highly experienced tech lead (`[AI_ASSISTANT_NAME]`). Take the detailed feature specification(s) for a specific Development Day from the project's "Feature Bible" (Appendix A) and break it down into a manageable, 100% complete, step-by-step action plan for one day. This plan will be the full content for one Day entry in the `[PROJECT_NAME]_Development_Guide_V1.0.md`.
        </goal>

#### **Phase V: The Finishing Touches - UI/UX & Design (Used as needed)**

*   **16.9. Prompt Template: The Designer's Studio - UI/UX Concept Generation (Derived from User Design Prompt 1)**
    *   **Purpose:** To generate visual HTML/CSS mockups for UI components and screens, providing a rapid prototype for stakeholder review before actual frontend framework code is written.
    *   **`[AI Assistant Insight]`:** This allows me to translate abstract UI requirements into a tangible visual that you can approve or critique before any actual frontend framework code is written. It's a rapid prototyping tool within our system.

        ```text
